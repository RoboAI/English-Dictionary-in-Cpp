N

Defn: N, the fourteenth letter of English alphabet, is a vocal
consonent, and, in allusion to its mode of formation, is called the
dentinasal or linguanasal consonent. Its commoner sound is that heard
in ran, done; but when immediately followed in the same word by the
sound of g hard or k (as in single, sink, conquer), it usually
represents the same sound as the digraph ng in sing, bring, etc. This
is a simple but related sound, and is called the gutturo-nasal
consonent. See Guide to Pronunciation, §§ 243-246. The letter N came
into English through the Latin and Greek from the Phoenician, which
probably derived it from the Egyptian as the ultimate origin. It is
etymologically most closely related to M. See M.

that their gratitude made them, notwithstanding his prohibition,
proclaim the wonders he had done. Dr. H. More.

Note: Notwithstanding was, by Johnson and Webster, viewed as a
participle absolute, an English equivalent of the Latin non obstante.
Its several meanings, either as preposition, adverb, or conjunction,
are capable of being explained in this view. Later grammarians, while
admitting that the word was originally a participle, and can be
treated as such, prefer to class it as a preposition or disjunctive
conjunction.

Syn.
 -- In spite of; despite.
 -- Notwithstanding, In spite of, Despite. These words and phrases
are often interchanged, but there is a difference between them,
chiefly in strength. Notwithstanding is the weaker term, and simply
points to some obstacle that may exist; as, I shall go,
notwithstanding the rain. In spite or despite of has reference
primarily to active opposition to be encountered from others; as,
"I'll be, in man's despite, a monarch; " "I'll keep mine own, despite
of all the world." Shak. Hence, these words, when applied to things,
suppose greater opposition than notwithstanding. We should say. "He
was thrust rudely out of doors in spite of his entreaties," rather
than "notwithstanding". On the other hand, it would be more civil to
say, "Notwithstanding all you have said, I must still differ with
you."

NOTWITHSTANDING
Not`with*stand"ing, adv. or conj. Etym: [Originally the participle of
withstand, with not prefixed.]

Defn: Nevertheless; however; although; as, I shall go,

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
