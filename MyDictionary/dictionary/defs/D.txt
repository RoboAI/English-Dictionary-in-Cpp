1. The cessation of all vital phenomena without capability of
resuscitation, either in animals or plants.

Note: Local death is going on at times and in all parts of the living
body, in which individual cells and elements are being cast off and

kinds; death of the body as a whole (somatic or systemic death), and
death of the tissues. By the former is implied the absolute cessation
of the functions of the brain, the circulatory and the respiratory
organs; by the latter the entire disappearance of the vital actions

Syn.
 -- Death, Decrase, Departure, Release. Death applies to the
termination of every form of existence, both animal and vegetable;
the other words only to the human race. Decease is the term used in
law for the removal of a human being out of life in the ordinary
course of nature. Demise was formerly confined to decease of princes,
but is now sometimes used of distinguished men in general; as, the
demise of Mr. Pitt. Departure and release are peculiarly terms of
Christian affection and hope. A violent death is not usually called a
decease. Departure implies a friendly taking leave of life. Release
implies a deliverance from a life of suffering or sorrow.

in the victim, and intention to deceive in the deluder. But it is
often used reflexively, indicating that a person's own weakness has
made him the sport of others or of fortune; as, he deluded himself
with a belief that luck would always favor him. To mislead is to

fixed purpose to adhere. Resolution is the necessary result in a mind
which is characterized by firmness. It is a spirit which scatters

Syn.
 -- Decline, Decay, Consumption. Decline marks the first stage in a
downward progress; decay indicates the second stage, and denotes a
tendency to ultimate destruction; consumption marks a steady decay
from an internal exhaustion of strength. The health may experience a
decline from various causes at any period of life; it is naturally
subject to decay with the advance of old age; consumption may take
place at almost any period of life, from disease which wears out the
constitution. In popular language decline is often used as synonymous
with consumption. By a gradual decline, states and communities lose
their strength and vigor; by progressive decay, they are stripped of
their honor, stability, and greatness; by a consumption of their
resources and vital energy, they are led rapidly on to a completion
of their existence.

Syn.
 -- Delusion, Illusion. These words both imply some deception
practiced upon the mind. Delusion is deception from want of
knowledge; illusion is deception from morbid imagination. An illusion
is a false show, a mere cheat on the fancy or senses. It is, in other
words, some idea or image presented to the bodily or mental vision
which does not exist in reality. A delusion is a false judgment,
usually affecting the real concerns of life. Or, in other words, it
is an erroneous view of something which exists indeed, but has by no
means the qualities or attributes ascribed to it. Thus we speak of
the illusions of fancy, the illusions of hope, illusive prospects,
illusive appearances, etc. In like manner, we speak of the delusions
of stockjobbing, the delusions of honorable men, delusive appearances
in trade, of being deluded by a seeming excellence. "A fanatic,
either religious or political, is the subject of strong delusions;
while the term illusion is applied solely to the visions of an
uncontrolled imagination, the chimerical ideas of one blinded by
hope, passion, or credulity, or lastly, to spectral and other ocular
deceptions, to which the word delusion is never applied." Whately.

 -- Depravity, Depravation, Corruption. Depravilty is a vitiated
state of mind or feeling; as, the depravity of the human heart;
depravity of public morals. Depravation points to the act or process
of making depraved, and hence to the end thus reached; as, a gradual
depravation of principle; a depravation of manners, of the heart,
etc. Corruption is the only one of these words which applies to
physical substances, and in reference to these denotes the process by
which their component parts are dissolved. Hence, when figuratively
used, it denotes an utter vitiation of principle or feeling.
Depravity applies only to the mind and heart: we can speak of a
depraved taste, or a corrupt taste; in the first we introduce the
notion that there has been the influence of bad training to pervert;
in the second, that there is a want of true principle to pervert; in
the second, that there is a want of true principles to decide. The
other two words have a wider use: we can speak of the depravation or
the corruption of taste and public sentiment. Depravity is more or
less open; corruption is more or less disguised in its operations.
What is depraved requires to be reformed; what is corrupt requires to
be purified.

DIS-
Dis- (; 258)

Defn: .

1. A prefix from the Latin, whence F. dés, or sometimes dé-, dis-.
The Latin dis- appears as di- before b, d, g, l, m, n, r, v, becomes
dif- before f, and either dis- or di- before j. It is from the same
root as bis twice, and duo, E. two. See Two, and cf. Bi-, Di-, Dia-.
Dis- denotes separation, a parting from, as in distribute,
disconnect; hence it often has the force of a privative and negative,
as in disarm, disoblige, disagree. Also intensive, as in dissever.

Note: Walker's rule of pronouncing this prefix is, that the s ought
always to be pronounced like z, when the next syllable is accented
and begins with "a flat mute [b, d, v, g, z], a liquid [l, m, n, r],
or a vowel; as, disable, disease, disorder, disuse, disband, disdain,
disgrace, disvalue, disjoin, dislike, dislodge, dismay, dismember,
dismiss, dismount, disnatured, disrank, disrelish, disrobe." Dr.
Webster's example in disapproving of Walker's rule and pronouncing
dis- as diz in only one (disease) of the above words, is followed by
recent orthoëpists. See Disable, Disgrace, and the other words,
beginning with dis-, in this Dictionary.

denotes a fixed and habitual dislike; as, an aversion to or for

hostility something proposed (repugnance being the stronger); as, a
reluctance to make the necessary sacrifices, and a repugnance to the

feeling; as, a disgust at gross exhibitions of selfishness. Antipathy
is primarily an instinctive feeling of dislike of a thing, such as
most persons feel for a snake. When used figuratively, it denotes a
correspondent dislike for certain persons, modes of acting, etc. Men
have an aversion to what breaks in upon their habits; a reluctance
and repugnance to what crosses their will; a disgust at what offends
their sensibilities; and are often governed by antipathies for which
they can give no good reason.

as an auxiliary, is supposed to have been first used before
imperatives. It expresses entreaty or earnest request; as, do help
me. In the imperative mood, but not in the indicative, it may be used

sultry heat of summer, and of the maladies which then prevailed. But
as the conjunction does not occur at the same time in all latitudes,
and is not constant in the same region for a long period, there has
been much variation in calendars regarding the limits of the dog
days. The astronomer Roger Long states that in an ancient calendar in
Bede (died 735) the beginning of dog days is placed on the 14th of
July; that in a calendar prefixed to the Common Prayer, printed in
the time of Queen Elizabeth, they were said to begin on the 6th of
July and end on the 5th of September; that, from the Restoration
(1660) to the beginning of New Style (1752), British almanacs placed
the beginning on the 19th of July and the end on the 28th of August;
and that after 1752 the beginning was put on the 30th of July, the
end on the 7th of September. Some English calendars now put the
beginning on July 3d, and the ending on August 11th. A popular

Syn.
 -- To Draw, Drag. Draw differs from drag in this, that drag implies
a natural inaptitude for drawing, or positive resistance; it is
applied to things pulled or hauled along the ground, or moved with
toil or difficulty. Draw is applied to all bodies moved by force in
advance, whatever may be the degree of force; it commonly implies
that some kind of aptitude or provision exists for drawing. Draw is
the more general or generic term, and drag the more specific. We say,
the horses draw a coach or wagon, but they drag it through mire; yet
draw is properly used in both cases.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
