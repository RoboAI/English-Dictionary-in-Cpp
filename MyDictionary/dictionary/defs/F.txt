FAT
Fat, n.

1. (Physiol. Chem.)

Defn: An oily liquid or greasy substance making up the main bulk of
the adipose tissue of animals, and widely distributed in the seeds of
plants. See Adipose tissue, under Adipose.

Note: Animal fats are composed mainly of three distinct fats,
tristearin, tripalmitin, and triolein, mixed in varying proportions.
As olein is liquid at ordinary temperatures, while the other two fats
are solid, it follows that the consistency or hardness of fats
depends upon the relative proportion of the three individual fats.
During the life of an animal, the fat is mainly in a liquid state in
the fat cells, owing to the solubility of the two solid fats in the
more liquid olein at the body temperature. Chemically, fats are
composed of fatty acid, as stearic, palmitic, oleic, etc., united
with glyceryl. In butter fat, olein and palmitin predominate, mixed
with another fat characteristic of butter, butyrin. In the vegetable
kingdom many other fats or glycerides are to be found, as myristin
from nutmegs, a glyceride of lauric acid in the fat of the bay tree,
etc.

2. The best or richest productions; the best part; as, to live on the

punishment may be added, according to the degree of guilt.

3. A heinous crime; especially, a crime punishable by death or
imprisonment.

Note: Forfeiture for crime having been generally abolished in the
United States, the term felony, in American law, has lost this point
of distinction; and its meaning, where not fixed by statute, is
somewhat vague and undefined; generally, however, it is used to
denote an offense of a high grade, punishable either capitally or by
a term of imprisonment. In Massachusetts, by statute, any crime
punishable by death or imprisonment in the state prison, and no
other, is a felony; so in New York. the tendency now is to obliterate
the distinction between felonies and misdemeanors; and this has been
done partially in England, and completely in some of the States of
the Union. The distinction is purely arbitrary, and its entire
abolition is only a question of time.

Note: There is no lawyer who would undertake to tell what a felony
is, otherwise than by enumerating the various kinds of offenses which
are so called. originally, the word felony had a meaning: it denoted
all offenses the penalty of which included forfeiture of goods; but
subsequent acts of Parliament have declared various offenses to be
felonies, without enjoining that penalty, and have taken away the
penalty from others, which continue, nevertheless, to be called
felonies, insomuch that the acts so called have now no property
whatever in common, save that of being unlawful and purnishable. J.
S. Mill.

Fer`men*ta"tion, n. Etym: [Cf. F. fermentation.]

1. The process of undergoing an effervescent change, as by the action
of yeast; in a wider sense (Physiol. Chem.), the transformation of an
organic substance into new compounds by the action of a ferment,
either formed or unorganized. It differs in kind according to the
nature of the ferment which causes it.

2. A state of agitation or excitement, as of the intellect or the
feelings.
It puts the soul to fermentation and activity. Jer. Taylor.
A univesal fermentation of human thought and faith. C. Kingsley.
Acetous, or Acetic, fermentation, a form of oxidation in which
alcohol is converted into vinegar or acetic acid by the agency of a
specific fungus or ferment (Mycoderma aceti). The process involves
two distinct reactions, in which the oxygen of the air is essential.
An intermediate product, aldehyde, is formed in the first process. 1.
C2H6O + O = H2O + C2H4O

Note: Alcohol. Water. Aldehyde. 2. C2H4O + O = C2H4O2

Note: Aldehyde. Acetic acid.
 -- Alcoholic fermentation, the fermentation which saccharine bodies
undergo when brought in contact with the yeast plant or Torula. The
sugar is converted, either directly or indirectly, into alcohol and
carbonic acid, the rate of action being dependent on the rapidity
with which the Torulæ develop.
 -- Ammoniacal fermentation, the conversion of the urea of the urine
into ammonium carbonate, through the growth of the special urea
ferment. CON2H4 + 2H2O = (NH4)2CO3

Note: Urea. Water. Ammonium carbonate.

Note: Whenever urine is exposed to the air in open vessels for
several days it undergoes this alkaline fermentation.
 -- Butyric fermentation, the decomposition of various forms of
organic matter, through the agency of a peculiar worm-shaped vibrio,
with formation of more or less butyric acid. It is one of the many
forms of fermentation that collectively constitute putrefaction. See
Lactic fermentation.
 -- Fermentation by an unorganized ferment or enzyme. Fermentations
of this class are purely chemical reactions, in which the ferment
acts as a simple catalytic agent. Of this nature are the
decomposition or inversion of cane sugar into levulose and dextrose
by boiling with dilute acids, the conversion of starch into dextrin
and sugar by similar treatment, the conversion of starch into like
products by the action of diastase of malt or ptyalin of saliva, the
conversion of albuminous food into peptones and other like products
by the action of pepsin-hydrochloric acid of the gastric juice or by
the ferment of the pancreatic juice.
 -- Fermentation theory of disease (Biol. & Med.), the theory that
most if not all, infectious or zymotic disease are caused by the
introduction into the organism of the living germs of ferments, or
ferments already developed (organized ferments), by which processes
of fermentation are set up injurious to health. See Germ theory.
 -- Glycerin fermentation, the fermentation which occurs on mixing a
dilute solution of glycerin with a peculiar species of schizomycetes
and some carbonate of lime, and other matter favorable to the growth
of the plant, the glycerin being changed into butyric acid, caproic
acid, butyl, and ethyl alcohol. With another form of bacterium
(Bacillus subtilis) ethyl alcohol and butyric acid are mainly formed.
 -- Lactic fermentation, the transformation of milk sugar or other
saccharine body into lactic acid, as in the souring of milk, through
the agency of a special bacterium (Bacterium lactis of Lister). In
this change the milk sugar, before assuming the form of lactic acid,
presumably passes through the stage of glucose. C12H22O11.H2O =
4C3H6O3

Note: Hydrated milk sugar. Lactic acid.

Note: In the lactic fermentation of dextrose or glucose, the lactic
acid which is formed is very prone to undergo butyric fermentation
after the manner indicated in the following equation: 2C3H6O3 (lactic
acid) = C4H8O2 (butyric acid) + 2CO2 (carbonic acid) + 2H2 (hydrogen
gas).
 -- Putrefactive fermentation. See Putrefaction.

1. (Opt.)

Defn: A point in which the rays of light meet, after being reflected
or refrcted, and at which the image is formed; as, the focus of a
lens or mirror.

2. (Geom.)

Defn: A point so related to a conic section and certain straight line
called the directrix that the ratio of the distace between any point
of the curve and the focus to the distance of the same point from the
directrix is constant.

Note: Thus, in the ellipse FGHKLM, A is the focus and CD the
directrix, when the ratios FA:FE, GA:GD, MA:MC, etc., are all equal.
So in the hyperbola, A is the focus and CD the directrix when the
ratio HA:HK is constant for all points of the curve; and in the
parabola, A is the focus and CD the directrix when the ratio BA:BC is
constant. In the ellipse this ratio is less than unity, in the
parabola equal to unity, and in the hyperbola greater than unity. The
ellipse and hyperbola have each two foci, and two corresponding
directrixes, and the parabola has one focus and one directrix. In the
ellipse the sum of the two lines from any point of the curve to the
two foci is constant; that is: AG+GB=AH+HB; and in the hyperbola the
difference of the corresponding lines is constant. The diameter which
passes through the foci of the ellipse is the major axis. The
diameter which being produced passes through the foci of the
hyperbola is the transverse axis. The middle point of the major or
the transverse axis is the center of the curve. Certain other curves,
as the lemniscate and the Cartesian ovals, have points called foci,
possessing properties similar to those of the foci of conic sections.
In an ellipse, rays of light coming from one focus, and reflected
from the curve, proceed in lines directed toward the other; in an
hyperbola, in lines directed from the other; in a parabola, rays from
the focus, after reflection at the curve, proceed in lines parallel
to the axis. Thus rays from A in the ellipse are reflected to B; rays
from A in the hyperbola are reflected toward L and M away from B.

3. A central point; a point of concentration. Aplanatic focus. (Opt.)
See under Aplanatic.
 -- Conjugate focus (Opt.), the focus for rays which have a sensible
divergence, as from a near object; -- so called because the positions

effect.
 -- Principal, or Solar, focus (Opt.), the focus for parallel rays.

FOOD
Food, n. Etym: [OE. fode, AS. foda; akin to Icel. fæ\'eba, fæ\'ebi,
Sw. föda, Dan. & LG. föde, OHG. fatunga, Gr. patei^sthai to eat, and
perh. to Skr. pa to protect, L. pascere to feed, pasture, pabulum
food, E. pasture. *75. Cf. Feed, Fodder food, Foster to cherish.]

1. What is fed upon; that which goes to support life by being
received within, and assimilated by, the organism of an animal or a
plant; nutriment; aliment; especially, what is eaten by animals for
nourishment.

Note: In a physiological sense, true aliment is to be distinguished
as that portion of the food which is capable of being digested and
absorbed into the blood, thus furnishing nourishment, in distinction
from the indigestible matter which passes out through the alimentary
canal as fæces.

Note: Foods are divided into two main groups: nitrogenous, or
proteid, foods, i.e., those which contain nitrogen, and
nonnitrogenous, i.e., those which do not contain nitrogen. The latter
group embraces the fats and carbohydrates, which collectively are
sometimes termed heat producers or respiratory foods, since by
oxidation in the body they especially subserve the production of
heat. The proteids, on the other hand, are known as plastic foods or
tissue formers, since no tissue can be formed without them. These
latter terms, however, are misleading, since proteid foods may also
give rise to heat both directly and indirectly, and the fats and
carbohydrates are useful in other ways than in producing heat.

2. Anything that instructs the intellect, excites the feelings, or
molds habits of character; that which nourishes.
This may prove food to my displeasure. Shak.
In this moment there is life and food For future years. Wordsworth.

of the spaces in the interior of a protozoan in which food is
contained, during digestion.

alteration in the former. Each quantity is said to be a function of
the other. Thus, the circumference of a circle is a function of the
diameter. If x be a symbol to which different numerical values can be
assigned, such expressions as x2, 3x, Log. x, and Sin. x, are all
functions of x. Algebraic function, a quantity whose connection with
the variable is expressed by an equation that involves only the
algebraic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division, raising to a given power, and extracting a given root; --
opposed to transcendental function.
 -- Arbitrary function. See under Arbitrary.
 -- Calculus of functions. See under Calculus.
 -- Carnot's function (Thermo-dynamics), a relation between the
amount of heat given off by a source of heat, and the work which can
be done by it. It is approximately equal to the mechanical equivalent

in degrees of the air thermometer, reckoned from its zero of
expansion.
 -- Circular functions. See Inverse trigonometrical functions
(below).
 -- Continuous function, a quantity that has no interruption in the
continuity of its real values, as the variable changes between any
specified limits.
 -- Discontinuous function. See under Discontinuous.
 -- Elliptic functions, a large and important class of functions, so
called because one of the forms expresses the relation of the arc of
an ellipse to the straight lines connected therewith.
 -- Explicit function, a quantity directly expressed in terms of the
independently varying quantity; thus, in the equations y = 6x2, y =
10 -x3, the quantity y is an explicit function of x.
 -- Implicit function, a quantity whose relation to the variable is
expressed indirectly by an equation; thus, y in the equation x2 + y2
= 100 is an implicit function of x.
 -- Inverse trigonometrical functions, or Circular function, the
lengths of arcs relative to the sines, tangents, etc. Thus, AB is the
arc whose sine is BD, and (if the length of BD is x) is written sin -
1x, and so of the other lines. See Trigonometrical function (below).
Other transcendental functions are the exponential functions, the
elliptic functions, the gamma functions, the theta functions, etc.
 -- One-valued function, a quantity that has one, and only one, value
for each value of the variable.
 -- Transcendental functions, a quantity whose connection with the
variable cannot be expressed by algebraic operations; thus, y in the
equation y = 10x is a transcendental function of x. See Algebraic
function (above).
 -- Trigonometrical function, a quantity whose relation to the
variable is the same as that of a certain straight line drawn in a
circle whose radius is unity, to the length of a corresponding are of
the circle. Let AB be an arc in a circle, whose radius OA is unity
let AC be a quadrant, and let OC, DB, and AF be drawnpependicular to
OA, and EB and CG parallel to OA, and let OB be produced to G and F.
E Then BD is the sine of the arc AB; OD or EB is the cosine, AF is
the tangent, CG is the cotangent, OF is the secant OG is the
cosecant, AD is the versed sine, and CE is the coversed sine of the
are AB. If the length of AB be represented by x (OA being unity) then
the lengths of Functions. these lines (OA being unity) are the
trigonometrical functions of x, and are written sin x, cos x, tan x
(or tang x), cot x, sec x, cosec x, versin x, coversin x. These
quantities are also considered as functions of the angle BOA.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or

Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
