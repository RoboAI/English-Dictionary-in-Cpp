W

Defn: W, the twenty-third letter of the English alphabet, is usually
a consonant, but sometimes it is a vowel, forming the second element
of certain diphthongs, as in few, how. It takes its written form and
its name from the repetition of a V, this being the original form of
the Roman capital letter which we call U. Etymologically it is most
related to v and u. See V, and U. Some of the uneducated classes in
England, especially in London, confuse w and v, substituting the one
for the other, as weal for veal, and veal for weal; wine for vine,
and vine for wine, etc. See Guide to Pronunciation, §§ 266-268.

What see'st thou in the ground Shak.
What is man, that thou art mindful of him Ps. viii. 4.
What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!
Matt. viii. 27.

Note: Originally, what, when, where, which, who, why, etc., were
interrogatives only, and it is often difficult to determine whether
they are used as interrogatives or relatives. What in this sense,
when it refers to things, may be used either substantively or
adjectively; when it refers to persons, it is used only adjectively
with a noun expressed, who being the pronoun used substantively.

2. As an exclamatory word: -- (a) Used absolutely or independently; -
- often with a question following. "What welcome be thou." Chaucer.
What, could ye not watch with me one hour Matt. xxvi. 40.

Knolles.

Note: In such phrases as I tell you what, what anticipates the
following statement, being elliptical for what I think, what it is,
how it is, etc. "I tell thee what, corporal Bardolph, I could tear
her." Shak. Here what relates to the last clause, "I could tear her;"
this is what I tell you. What not is often used at the close of an
enumeration of several particulars or articles, it being an
abbreviated clause, the verb of which, being either the same as that
of the principal clause or a general word, as be, say, mention,
enumerate, etc., is omitted. "Men hunt, hawk, and what not." Becon.
"Some dead puppy, or log, orwhat not." C. Kingsley. "Battles,
tournaments, hunts, and what not." De Quincey. Hence, the words are
often used in a general sense with the force of a substantive,
equivalent to anything you please, a miscellany, a variety, etc. From
this arises the name whatnot, applied to an étagère, as being a piece
of furniture intended for receiving miscellaneous articles of use or
ornament. But what is used for but that, usually after a negative,
and excludes everything contrary to the assertion in the following
sentence. "Her needle is not so absolutely perfect in tent and cross
stitch but what my superintendence is advisable." Sir W. Scott.
"Never fear but what our kite shall fly as high." Ld. Lytton. What
ho! an exclamation of calling.

etc., often with the implication that it is of no consequence. "All
this is so; but what of this, my lord" Shak. "The night is spent,
why, what of that" Shak.
 -- What though, even granting that; allowing that; supposing it true
that. "What though the rose have prickles, yet't is plucked." Shak.

limbs in those places, sometimes finishing by two or three blows on
the chest or stomach, which usually put an end to the life of the
criminal, and were hence called coups-de-grace -- blows of mercy. The

willeo, willio, D. wil, G. wille, Icel. vili, Dan. villie, Sw. vilja,
Goth wilja. See Will, v.]

1. The power of choosing; the faculty or endowment of the soul by
which it is capable of choosing; the faculty or power of the mind by
which we decide to do or not to do; the power or faculty of
preferring or selecting one of two or more objects.
It is necessary to form a distinct notion of what is meant by the
word "volition" in order to understand the import of the word will,
for this last word expresses the power of mind of which "volition" is
the act. Stewart.
Will is an ambiguous word, being sometimes put for the faculty of
willing; sometimes for the act of that faculty, besides [having]
other meanings. But "volition" always signifies the act of willing,
and nothing else. Reid.
Appetite is the will's solicitor, and the will is appetite's
controller; what we covet according to the one, by the other we often
reject. Hooker.
The will is plainly that by which the mind chooses anything. J.
Edwards.

2. The choice which is made; a determination or preference which
results from the act or exercise of the power of choice; a volition.
The word "will," however, is not always used in this its proper
acceptation, but is frequently substituted for "volition", as when I
say that my hand mover in obedience to my will. Stewart.

3. The choice or determination of one who has authority; a decree; a
command; discretionary pleasure.
Thy will be done. Matt. vi. 10.
Our prayers should be according to the will of God. Law.

4. Strong wish or inclination; desire; purpose.

Note: "Inclination is another word with which will is frequently
confounded. Thus, when the apothecary says, in Romeo and Juliet, --
My poverty, but not my will, consents; . . . Put this in any liquid
thing you will, And drink it off. the word will is plainly used as,
synonymous with inclination; not in the strict logical sense, as the
immediate antecedent of action. It is with the same latitude that the
word is used in common conversation, when we speak of doing a thing
which duty prescribes, against one's own will; or when we speak of
doing a thing willingly or unwillingly." Stewart.

5. That which is strongly wished or desired.
What's your will, good friar Shak.
The mariner hath his will. Coleridge.

6. Arbitrary disposal; power to control, dispose, or determine.
Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies. Ps. xxvii. 12.

7
7 (Law)

Defn: The legal declaration of a person's mind as to the manner in
which he would have his property or estate disposed of after his
death; the written instrument, legally executed, by which a man makes
disposition of his estate, to take effect after his death; testament;
devise. See the Note under Testament, 1.

Note: Wills are written or nuncupative, that is, oral. See
Nuncupative will, under Nuncupative. At will (Law), at pleasure. To
hold an estate at the will of another, is to enjoy the possession at
his pleasure, and be liable to be ousted at any time by the lessor or
proprietor. An estate at will is at the will of both parties.
 -- Good will. See under Good.
 -- Ill will, enmity; unfriendliness; malevolence.
 -- To have one's will, to obtain what is desired; to do what one
pleases.
 -- Will worship, worship according to the dictates of the will or
fancy; formal worship. [Obs.] -- Will worshiper, one who offers will
worship. [Obs.] Jer. Taylor.
 -- With a will, with willingness and zeal; with all one's heart or
strength; earnestly; heartily.

WILL
Will, v. t. & auxiliary. [imp. Would. Indic. present, I will (Obs. I
wol), thou wilt, he will (Obs. he wol); we, ye, they will.] Etym:
[OE. willen, imp. wolde; akin to OS. willan, OFries. willa, D.
willen, G. wollen, OHG. wollan, wellan, Icel. & Sw. vilja, Dan.
ville, Goth. wiljan, OSlav. voliti, L. velle to wish, volo I wish;
cf. Skr. vrs to choose, to prefer. Cf. Voluntary, Welcome, Well,
adv.]

1. To wish; to desire; to incline to have.
A wife as of herself no thing ne sholde [should] Wille in effect, but
as her husband wolde [would]. Chaucer.
Caleb said unto her, What will thou Judg. i. 14.
They would none of my counsel. Prov. i. 30.

2. As an auxiliary, will is used to denote futurity dependent on the
verb. Thus, in first person, "I will" denotes willingness, consent,
promise; and when "will" is emphasized, it denotes determination or
fixed purpose; as, I will go if you wish; I will go at all hazards.
In the second and third persons, the idea of distinct volition, wish,
or purpose is evanescent, and simple certainty is appropriately
expressed; as, "You will go," or "He will go," describes a future
event as a fact only. To emphasize will denotes (according to the
tone or context) certain futurity or fixed determination.

Note: Will, auxiliary, may be used elliptically for will go. "I'll to
her lodgings." Marlowe.

Note: As in shall (which see), the second and third persons may be
virtually converted into the first, either by question or indirect
statement, so as to receive the meaning which belongs to will in that
person; thus, "Will you go" (answer, "I will go") asks assent,
requests, etc.; while "Will he go" simply inquires concerning
futurity; thus, also,"He says or thinks he will go," "You say or
think you will go," both signify willingness or consent.

Note: Would, as the preterit of will, is chiefly employed in
conditional, subjunctive, or optative senses; as, he would go if he
could; he could go if he would; he said that he would go; I would
fain go, but can not; I would that I were young again; and other like
phrases. In the last use, the first personal pronoun is often
omitted; as, would that he were here; would to Heaven that it were
so; and, omitting the to in such an adjuration. "Would God I had died
for thee." Would is used for both present and future time, in
conditional propositions, and would have for past time; as, he would
go now if he were ready; if it should rain, he would not go; he would
have gone, had he been able. Would not, as also will not, signifies
refusal. "He was angry, and would not go in." Luke xv. 28. Would is
never a past participle.

Note: In Ireland, Scotland, and the United States, especially in the
southern and western portions of the United States, shall and will,
should and would, are often misused, as in the following examples: --
I am able to devote as much time and attention to other subjects as I
will [shall] be under the necessity of doing next winter. Chalmers.
A countryman, telling us what he had seen, remarked that if the
conflagration went on, as it was doing, we would [should] have, as
our next season's employment, the Old Town of Edinburgh to rebuild.
H. Miller.
I feel assured that I will [shall] not have the misfortune to find
conflicting views held by one so enlightened as your excellency. J.
Y. Mason.

WILL
Will, v. i.

Defn: To be willing; to be inclined or disposed; to be pleased; to
wish; to desire.
And behold, there came a leper and worshiped him, saying, Lord if
thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. And Jesus . . . touched him,
saying, I will; be thou clean. Matt. viii. 2, 3.

Note: This word has been confused with will, v. i., to choose, which,
unlike this, is of the weak conjugation. Will I, nill I, or Will ye,

and judgment; discretion; sagacity; skill; dexterity.
We speak also not in wise words of man's wisdom, but in the doctrine
of the spirit. Wyclif (1 Cor. ii. 13).
Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil
is understanding. Job xxviii. 28.

Syn.
 -- Prudence; knowledge. Wisdom, Prudence, Knowledge. Wisdom has been
defined to be "the use of the best means for attaining the best
ends." "We conceive," says Whewell, " prudence as the virtue by which
we select right means for given ends, while wisdom implies the
selection of right ends as well as of right means." Hence, wisdom
implies the union of high mental and moral excellence. Prudence (that
is, providence, or forecast) is of a more negative character; it
rather consists in avoiding danger than in taking decisive measures
for the accomplishment of an object. Sir Robert Walpole was in many
respects a prudent statesman, but he was far from being a wise one.
Burke has said that prudence, when carried too far, degenerates into
a "reptile virtue," which is the more dangerous for its plausible
appearance. Knowledge, a more comprehensive term, signifies the
simple apprehension of facts or relations. "In strictness of
language," says Paley, " there is a difference between knowledge and
wisdom; wisdom always supposing action, and action directed by it."
Knowledge and wisdom, far from being one, Have ofttimes no
connection. Knowledge dwells In heads replete with thoughts of other
men; Wisdom, in minds attentive to their own. Knowledge, a rude,
unprofitable mass, The mere materials with which wisdom builds, Till
smoothed, and squared, and fitted to its place, Does but encumber
whom it seems to enrich. Knowledge is proud that he has learned so
much; Wisdom is humble that he knows no more. Cowper.
Wisdom tooth, the last, or back, tooth of the full set on each half
of each jaw in man; -- familiarly so called, because appearing
comparatively late, after the person may be supposed to have arrived
at the age of wisdom. See the Note under Tooth, 1.

later Hellenistic reflective writing beginning with Philo Judæus.

WIT
Wit, n. Etym: [AS. witt, wit; akin to OFries. wit, G. witz, OHG.

xi. 34).

Will puts in practice what wit deviseth. Sir J. Davies.

3. Felicitous association of objects not usually connected, so as to

from serving thee. Shak.

Syn.
 -- Ingenuity; humor; satire; sarcasm; irony; burlesque.
 -- Wit, Humor. Wit primarily meant mind; and now denotes the power
of seizing on some thought or occurrence, and, by a sudden turn,
presenting it under aspects wholly new and unexpected -- apparently
natural and admissible, if not perfectly just, and bearing on the
subject, or the parties concerned, with a laughable keenness and
force. "What I want," said a pompous orator, aiming at his
antagonist, "is common sense." "Exactly!" was the whispered reply.
The pleasure we find in wit arises from the ingenuity of the turn,
the sudden surprise it brings, and the patness of its application to
the case, in the new and ludicrous relations thus flashed upon the
view. Humor is a quality more congenial to the English mind than wit.
It consists primarily in taking up the peculiarities of a humorist
(or eccentric person) and drawing them out, as Addison did those of
Sir Roger de Coverley, so that we enjoy a hearty, good-natured laugh
at his unconscious manifestation of whims and oddities. From this
original sense the term has been widened to embrace other sources of
kindly mirth of the same general character. In a well-known
caricature of English reserve, an Oxford student is represented as
standing on the brink of a river, greatly agitated at the sight of a
drowning man before him, and crying out, "O that I had been
introduced to this gentleman, that I might save his life! The,
"Silent Woman" of Ben Jonson is one of the most humorous productions,
in the original sense of the term, which we have in our language.

Note: Walker condemns the pronunciation woond as a "capricious

language, namely, that the Old English long sound written ou, and
pronounced like French ou or modern English oo, has regularly
changed, when accented, into the diphthongal sound usually written
with the same letters ou in modern English, as in ground, hound,
round, sound. The use of ou in Old English to represent the sound of
modern English oo was borrowed from the French, and replaced the
older and Anglo-Saxon spelling with u. It makes no difference whether
the word was taken from the French or not, provided it is old enough
in English to have suffered this change to what is now the common
sound of ou; but words taken from the French at a later time, or
influenced by French, may have the French sound. Wound gall (Zoöl.),
an elongated swollen or tuberous gall on the branches of the
grapevine, caused by a small reddish brown weevil (Ampeloglypter

hand-to-hand combat between two unarmed contestants who seek to throw
each other. The various styles of wrestling differ in their
definition of a fall and in the governing rules. In Greco-Roman
wrestling, tripping and taking hold of the legs are forbidden, and a
fall is gained (that is, the bout is won), by the contestant who pins
both his opponent's shoulders to the ground. In catch-as-catch-can
wrestling, all holds are permitted except such as may be barred by
mutual consent, and a fall is defined as in Greco-Roman style.
Lancashire style wrestling is essentially the same as catch-as-catch-
can. In Cumberland and Westmorland wrestling the contestants stand
chest to chest, grasping each other around the body. The one first
losing his hold, or touching the ground with any part of his body
except his feet, loses the bout. If both fall to the ground at the
same time, it is a dogfall, and must be wrestled over. In the
Cornwall and Devon wrestling, the wrestlers complete in strong loose
linen jackets, catching hold of the jacket, or anywhere above the
waist. Two shoulders and one hip, or two hips and one shoulder, must
touch the ground to constitute a fall, and if a man is thrown
otherwise than on his back the contestants get upon their feet and
the bout recommences.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

copied or distributed:

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
