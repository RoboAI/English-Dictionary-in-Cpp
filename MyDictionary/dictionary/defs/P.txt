Syn.
 -- To cover; cloak; hide; extenuate; conceal.
 -- To Palliate, Extenuate, Cloak. These words, as here compared, are
used in a figurative sense in reference to our treatment of wrong
action. We cloak in order to conceal completely. We extenuate a crime
when we endeavor to show that it is less than has been supposed; we
palliate a crime when we endeavor to cover or conceal its enormity,
at least in part. This naturally leads us to soften some of its
features, and thus palliate approaches extenuate till they have
become nearly or quite identical. "To palliate is not now used,
though it once was, in the sense of wholly cloaking or covering over,
as it might be, our sins, but in that of extenuating; to palliate our
faults is not to hide them altogether, but to seek to diminish their
guilt in part." Trench.

Norman French, both implying a giving back. The word pardon, being
early used in our Bible, has, in religious matters, the same sense as
forgiveness; but in the language of common life there is a difference
between them, such as we often find between corresponding Anglo-Saxon
and Norman words. Forgive points to inward feeling, and suppose
alienated affection; when we ask forgiveness, we primarily seek the
removal of anger. Pardon looks more to outward things or
consequences, and is often applied to trifling matters, as when we
beg pardon for interrupting a man, or for jostling him in a crowd.

two words are, therefore, very clearly distinguished from each other
in most cases which relate to the common concerns of life.

previous to Reid, used in a very extensive signification. By

in a sense almost as unexclusive as consciousness, in its widest
signification. By Reid this word was limited to our faculty
acquisitive of knowledge, and to that branch of this faculty whereby,
through the senses, we obtain a knowledge of the external world. But
his limitation did not stop here. In the act of external perception
he distinguished two elements, to which he gave the names of
perception and sensation. He ought perhaps to have called these
perception proper and sensation proper, when employed in his special
meaning." Sir W. Hamilton.

1. Literally, the love of, including the search after, wisdom; in

philosophy denotes the general laws or principles under which all the
subordinate phenomena or facts relating to that subject are
comprehended. Thus philosophy, when applied to God and the divine
government, is called theology; when applied to material objects, it
is called physics; when it treats of man, it is called anthropology
and psychology, with which are connected logic and ethics; when it
treats of the necessary conceptions and relations by which philosophy
is possible, it is called metaphysics.

Note: "Philosophy has been defined: tionscience of things divine and
human, and the causes in which they are contained; -- the science of
effects by their causes; -- the science of sufficient reasons; -- the
science of things possible, inasmuch as they are possible; -- the
science of things evidently deduced from first principles; -- the
science of truths sensible and abstract; -- the application of reason
to its legitimate objects; -- the science of the relations of all
knowledge to the necessary ends of human reason; -- the science of
the original form of the ego, or mental self; -- the science of
science; -- the science of the absolute; -- the scienceof the
absolute indifference of the ideal and real." Sir W. Hamilton.

Pho`to*syn"the*sis, n. (Plant Physiol.)

Defn: The process of constructive metabolism by which carbohydrates
are formed from water vapor and the carbon dioxide of the air in the
chlorophyll-containing tissues of plants exposed to the action of
light. It was formerly called assimilation, but this is now commonly

to carbon monoxide, which, uniting with the hydrogen of the water in
the cell, produces formaldehyde, the latter forming various sugars
through polymerization. Vines suggests that the carbohydrates are
secretion products of the chloroplasts, derived from decomposition of
previously formed proteids. The food substances are usually quickly
translocated, those that accumulate being changed to starch, which
appears in the cells almost simultaneously with the sugars. The
chloroplasts perform photosynthesis only in light and within a
certain range of temperature, varying according to climate. This is
the only way in which a plant is able to organize carbohydrates. All

Plant, n. Etym: [AS. plante, L. planta.]

1. A vegetable; an organized living being, generally without feeling
and voluntary motion, and having, when complete, a root, stem, and
leaves, though consisting sometimes only of a single leafy expansion,
or a series of cellules, or even a single cellule.

Note: Plants are divided by their structure and methods of
reproduction into two series, phænogamous or flowering plants, which
have true flowers and seeds, and cryptogamous or flowerless plants,
which have no flowers, and reproduce by minute one-celled spores. In
both series are minute and simple forms and others of great size and
complexity. As to their mode of nutrition, plants may be considered
as self-supporting and dependent. Self-supporting plants always
contain chlorophyll, and subsist on air and moisture and the matter
dissolved in moisture, and as a general rule they excrete oxygen, and
use the carbonic acid to combine with water and form the material for
their tissues. Dependent plants comprise all fungi and many flowering
plants of a parasitic or saprophytic nature. As a rule, they have no
chlorophyll, and subsist mainly or wholly on matter already
organized, thus utilizing carbon compounds already existing, and not
excreting oxygen. But there are plants which are partly dependent and
partly self-supporting. The movements of climbing plants, of some
insectivorous plants, of leaves, stamens, or pistils in certain
plants, and the ciliary motion of zoöspores, etc., may be considered
a kind of voluntary motion.

PLATONISM
Pla"to*nism, n. Etym: [Cf. F. Platonisme.]

1. The doctrines or philosophy by Plato or of his followers.

Note: Plato believed God to be an infinitely wise, just, and powerful
Spirit; and also that he formed the visible universe out of
preëxistent amorphous matter, according to perfect patterns of ideas
eternally existent in his own mind. Philosophy he considered as being
a knowledge of the true nature of things, as discoverable in those
eternal ideas after which all things were fashioned. In other words,
it is the knowledge of what is eternal, exists necessarily, and is
unchangeable; not of the temporary, the dependent, and changeable;
and of course it is not obtained through the senses; neither is it
the product of the understanding, which concerns itself only with the
variable and transitory; nor is it the result of experience and
observation; but it is the product of our reason, which, as partaking
of the divine nature, has innate ideas resembling the eternal ideas
of God. By contemplating these innate ideas, reasoning about them,
and comparing them with their copies in the visible universe, reason
can attain that true knowledge of things which is called philosophy.
Plato's professed followers, the Academics, and the New Platonists,
differed considerably from him, yet are called Platonists. Murdock.

POKER
Pok"er, n. Etym: [Of uncertain etymol.]

Defn: A game at cards derived from brag, and first played about 1835
in the Southwestern United States. Johnson's Cyc.

Note: A poker hand is played with a poker deck, composed of fifty-two
cards, of thirteeen values, each card value being represented once in
each of four "suits", namely spades, hearts, diamonds, and clubs. The
game is played in many variations, but almost invariably the stage of
decision as to who wins occurs when each player has five cards (or
chooses five cards from some larger number available to him). The
winner usually is the player with the highest-valued hand, but, in
some variations, the winner may be the player with the lowest-valued
hand. The value of a hand is ranked by hand types, representing the
relationships of the cards to each other. [The hand types are ranked
by the probability of receiving such a hand when dealt five cards.]
Within each hand type the value is also ranked by the values of the
cards. The hand types are labeled, in decreasing value: five of a
kind; royal flush; straight flush; four of a kind; full house (coll.
full boat, or boat); flush; straight; three of a kind; two pairs; one
pair; and, when the contending players have no hands of any of the
above types, the player with the highest-valued card wins -- if there
is a tie, the next-highest-valued card of the tied players determines
the winner, and so on. If two players have the same type of hand, the
value of the cards within each type determines the winner; thus, if
two players both have three of a kind (and no other player has a
higher type of hand), the player whose three matched cards have the
highest card value is the winner.

Pok"er, n. Etym: [Cf. Dan. pokker the deuce, devil, also W. pwci, a

parthogenetic ova only one. The first polar body formed is usually
larger than the second one, and often divides into two after its
separation from the ovum. Each of the polar bodies removes maternal
chromatin from the ovum to make room for the chromatin of the
fertilizing spermatozoön; but their functions are not fully
understood.

POLAR
Po"lar, n. (Conic Sections)

Defn: The right line drawn through the two points of contact of the
two tangents drawn from a given point to a given conic section. The
given point is called the pole of the line. If the given point lies
within the curve so that the two tangents become imaginary, there is
still a real polar line which does not meet the curve, but which
possesses other properties of the polar. Thus the focus and directrix

POLARIZATION
Po`lar*i*za"tion, n. Etym: [Cf. F. polarisation.]

1. The act of polarizing; the state of being polarized, or of having

2. (Opt.)

Defn: A peculiar affection or condition of the rays of light or heat,
in consequence of which they exhibit different properties in
different directions.

Note: If a beam of light, which has been reflected from a plate of
unsilvered glass at an angle of about 56°, be received upon a second
plate of glass similar to the former, and at the same angle of
incidence, the light will be readily reflected when the two planes of
incidence are parallel to each other, but will not be reflected when
the two planes of incidence are perpendicular to each other. The
light has, therefore, acquired new properties by reflection from the
first plate of glass, and is called polarized light, while the
modification which the light has experienced by this reflection is
called polarization. The plane in which the beam of light is
reflected from the first mirror is called the plane of polarization.
The angle of polarization is the angle at which a beam of light must
be reflected, in order that the polarization may be the most
complete. The term polarization was derived from the theory of
emission, and it was conceived that each luminous molecule has two
poles analogous to the poles of a magnet; but this view is not now
held. According to the undulatory theory, ordinary light is produced
by vibrations transverse or perpendicular to the direction of the
ray, and distributed as to show no distinction as to any particular
direction. But when, by any means, these, vibrations are made to take
place in one plane, the light is said to be plane polarized. If only
a portion of the vibrations lie in one plane the ray is said to be
partially polarized. Light may be polarized by several methods other
than by reflection, as by refraction through most crystalline media,
or by being transmitted obliquely through several plates of glass
with parallel faces. If a beam of polarized light be transmitted
through a crystal of quartz in the direction of its axis, the plane
of polarization will be changed by an angle proportional to the
thickness of the crystal. This phenomenon is called rotatory
polarization. A beam of light reflected from a metallic surface, or
from glass surfaces under certain peculiar conditions, acquires
properties still more complex, its vibrations being no longer
rectilinear, but circular, or elliptical. This phenomenon is called
circular or elliptical polarization.

3. (Elec.)

Defn: An effect produced upon the plates of a voltaic battery, or the
electrodes in an electrolytic cell, by the deposition upon them of
the gases liberated by the action of the current. It is chiefly due
to the hydrogen, and results in an increase of the resistance, and
the setting up of an opposing electro-motive force, both of which
tend materially to weaken the current of the battery, or that passing
through the cell.

POLICE POWER
Police power. (Law)

Defn: The inherent power of a government to regulate its police
affairs. The term police power is not definitely fixed in meaning. In
the earlier cases in the United States it was used as including the
whole power of internal government, or the powers of government
inherent in every sovereignty to the extent of its dominions (11
Peters (U. S.) 102). The later cases have excepted from its domain
the development and administration of private law. Modern political
science defines the power as a branch of internal administration in
the exercise of which the executive should move within the lines of
general principles prescribed by the constitution or the legislature,
and in the exercise of which the most local governmental
organizations should participate as far as possible (Burgess). Under
this limitation the police power, as affecting persons, is the power
of the state to protect the public against the abuse of individual
liberty, that is, to restrain the individual in the exercise of his
rights when such exercise becomes a danger to the community. The
tendency of judicial and popular usage is towards this narrower
definition.

POST-IMPRESSIONISM
Post`-im*pres"sion*ism, n. (Painting)

Defn: In the broadest sense, the theory or practice of any of several
groups of recent painters, or of these groups taken collectively,
whose work and theories have in common a tendency to reaction against
the scientific and naturalistic character of impressionism and neo-
impressionism. In a strict sense the term post-impressionism is used
to denote the effort at self-expression, rather than representation,
shown in the work of Cézanne, Matisse, etc.; but it is more broadly
used to include cubism, the theory or practice of a movement in both
painting and  sculpture which lays stress upon volume as the
important attribute of objects and attempts its expression by the use
of geometrical figures or solids only; and futurism, a theory or
practice which attempts to place the observer within the picture and
to represent simultaneously a number of consecutive movements and
impressions. In practice these theories and methods of the post-
impressionists change with great rapidity and shade into one another,
so that a picture may be both cubist and futurist in character. They
tend to, and sometimes reach, a condition in which both
representation and traditional decoration are entirely abolished and
a work of art becomes a purely subjective expression in an arbitrary

Note: In physical science, the properties of matter are distinguished
to the three following classes: 1. Physical properties, or those
which result from the relations of bodies to the physical agents,
light, heat, electricity, gravitation, cohesion, adhesion, etc., and
which are exhibited without a change in the composition or kind of
matter acted on. They are color, luster, opacity, transparency,
hardness, sonorousness, density, crystalline form, solubility,
capability of osmotic diffusion, vaporization, boiling, fusion, etc.
2. Chemical properties, or those which are conditioned by affinity
and composition; thus, combustion, explosion, and certain solutions
are reactions occasioned by chemical properties. Chemical properties
are identical when there is identity of composition and structure,
and change according as the composition changes. 3. Organoleptic
properties, or those forming a class which can not be included in
either of the other two divisions. They manifest themselves in the
contact of substances with the organs of taste, touch, and smell, or
otherwise affect the living organism, as in the manner of medicines
and poisons.

2. An acquired or artificial quality; that which is given by art, or
bestowed by man; as, the poem has the properties which constitute
excellence.

bears the same relation to 10 as 8 does to 16. Hence, such numbers

together with the one sought, are proportional. Continued proportion,
Inverse proportion, etc. See under Continued, Inverse, etc.
 -- Harmonical, or Musical, proportion, a relation of three or four
quantities, such that the first is to the last as the difference
between the first two is to the difference between the last two;

Thus, 24, 16, 12, 9, are harmonical, for 24:9::8:3.
 -- In proportion, according as; to the degree that. "In proportion
as they are metaphysically true, they are morally and politically

Defn: A wheel with a broad rim, or grooved rim, for transmitting
power from, or imparting power to, the different parts of machinery,
or for changing the direction of motion, by means of a belt, cord,
rope, or chain.

Note: The pulley, as one of the mechanical powers, consists, in its
simplest form, of a grooved wheel, called a sheave, turning within a
movable frame or block, by means of a cord or rope attached at one
end to a fixed point. The force, acting on the free end of the rope,
is thus doubled, but can move the load through only half the space
traversed by itself. The rope may also pass over a sheave in another
block that is fixed. The end of the rope may be fastened to the
movable block, instead of a fixed point, with an additional gain of
power, and using either one or two sheaves in the fixed block. Other
sheaves may be added, and the power multiplied accordingly. Such an
apparatus is called by workmen a block and tackle, or a fall and
tackle. See Block. A single fixed pulley gives no increase of power,
but serves simply for changing the direction of motion. Band pulley,
or Belt pulley, a pulley with a broad face for transmitting power

to beat, strike; cf. Gr. Appeal, Compel, Impel, Push.]

1. (Physiol.)

Defn: The beating or throbbing of the heart or blood vessels,
especially of the arteries.

Note: In an artery the pulse is due to the expansion and contraction
of the elastic walls of the artery by the action of the heart upon
the column of blood in the arterial system. On the commencement of
the diastole of the ventricle, the semilunar valves are closed, and
the aorta recoils by its elasticity so as to force part of its
contents into the vessels farther onwards. These, in turn, as they
already contain a certain quantity of blood, expand, recover by an
elastic recoil, and transmit the movement with diminished intensity.
Thus a series of movements, gradually diminishing in intensity, pass
along the arterial system (see the Note under Heart). For the sake of
convenience, the radial artery at the wrist is generally chosen to
detect the precise character of the pulse. The pulse rate varies with
age, position, sex, stature, physical and psychical influences, etc.

2. Any measured or regular beat; any short, quick motion, regularly
repeated, as of a medium in the transmission of light, sound, etc.;
oscillation; vibration; pulsation; impulse; beat; movement.

semilunar valves over the arterial system, and gradually disappearing
in the smaller branches.
the pulse wave travels over the arterial system at the rate of about
29.5 feet in a second. H. N. Martin.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
