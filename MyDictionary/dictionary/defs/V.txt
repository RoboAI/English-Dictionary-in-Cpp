V

1. V, the twenty-second letter of the English alphabet, is a vocal
consonant. V and U are only varieties of the same character, U being
the cursive form, while V is better adapted for engraving, as in
stone. The two letters were formerly used indiscriminately, and till
a comparatively recent date words containing them were often classed
together in dictionaries and other books of reference (see U). The
letter V is from the Latin alphabet, where it was used both as a
consonant (about like English w) and as a vowel. The Latin derives it
from it from a form (V) of the Greek vowel UPSILON (see Y), this
Greek letter being either from the same Semitic letter as the digamma
F (see F), or else added by the Greeks to the alphabet which they
took from the Semitic. Etymologically v is most nearly related to u,
w, f, b, p; as in vine, wine; avoirdupois, habit, have; safe, save;
trover, troubadour, trope. See U, F, etc. See Guide to Pronunciation,
§ 265; also §§ 155, 169, 178-179, etc.

2. As a numeral, V stands for five, in English and Latin.

1. (Physics)

Defn: Any substance in the gaseous, or aëriform, state, the condition
of which is ordinarily that of a liquid or solid.

Note: The term vapor is sometimes used in a more extended sense, as
identical with gas; and the difference between the two is not so much
one of kind as of degree, the latter being applied to all permanently
elastic fluids except atmospheric air, the former to those elastic
fluids which lose that condition at ordinary temperatures. The
atmosphere contains more or less vapor of water, a portion of which,
on a reduction of temperature, becomes condensed into liquid water in
the form of rain or dew. The vapor of water produced by boiling,
especially in its economic relations, is called steam.
Vapor is any substance in the gaseous condition at the maximum of
density consistent with that condition. This is the strict and proper
meaning of the word vapor. Nichol.

2. In a loose and popular sense, any visible diffused substance
floating in the atmosphere and impairing its transparency, as smoke,
fog, etc.

Note: Varieties usually differ from species in that any two, however
unlike, will generally propagate indefinitely (unless they are in
their nature unfertile, as some varieties of rose and other
cultivated plants); in being a result of climate, food, or other
extrinsic conditions or influences, but generally by a sudden, rather
than a gradual, development; and in tending in many cases to lose
their distinctive peculiarities when the individuals are left to a
state of nature, and especially if restored to the conditions that
are natural to typical individuals of the species. Many varieties of
domesticated animals and of cultivated plants have been directly
produced by man.
(d) In inorganic nature, one of those forms in which a species may
occur, which differ in minor characteristics of structure, color,
purity of composition, etc.

Note: These may be viewed as variations from the typical species in
its most perfect and purest form, or, as is more commonly the case,
all the forms, including the latter, may rank as Varieties. Thus, the
sapphire is a blue variety, and the ruby a red variety, of corundum;
again, calcite has many Varieties differing in form and structure, as
Iceland spar, dogtooth spar, satin spar, and also others
characterized by the presence of small quantities of magnesia, iron,
manganese, etc. Still again, there are Varieties of granite differing
in structure, as graphic granite, porphyritic granite, and other
Varieties differing in composition, as albitic granite, hornblendic,

any species which is coincident with a geographical region, and is
usually dependent upon, or caused by, peculiarities of climate.
 -- Variety hybrid (Biol.), a cross between two individuals of
different varieties of the same species; a mongrel.

Syn.
 -- Diversity; difference; kind.
 -- Variety, Diversity. A man has a variety of employments when he
does many things which are not a mere repetition of the same act; he
has a diversity of employments when the several acts performed are
unlike each other, that is, diverse. In most cases, where there is
variety there will be more or less of diversity, but not always. One
who sells railroad tickets performs a great variety of acts in a day,
while there is but little diversity in his employment.

 -- Seeds with two or more cotyledons. Stems with the pith, woody

having few or no ducts in the woody fiber, and the seeds naked. 2.
Monocotyledons (called also Endogens).
 -- Seeds with single cotyledon. Stems with slender bundles of woody
fiber not concentrically arranged, and with no true bark.} II.

Pteridophyta, having the sporophoric plant conspicuous and consisting
partly of vascular tissue, as in Ferns, Lycopods, and Equiseta, and
Cellular Acrogens, or Bryophyta, having the sexual plant most
conspicuous, but destitute of vascular tissue, as in Mosses and Scale
Mosses. 2. Thallogens.
 -- Plants without distinct stem and leaves, consisting of a simple

Fungi, which contain no chlorophyll, and live on organic matter.
(Lichens are now believed to be fungi parasitic on included algæ.}

Note: Many botanists divide the Phænogamia primarily into Gymnosperms
and Angiosperms, and the latter into Dicotyledons and Monocotyledons.
Others consider Pteridophyta and Bryophyta to be separate classes.
Thallogens are variously divided by different writers, and the places
for diatoms, slime molds, and stoneworts are altogether uncertain.

VELOCITY
Ve*loc"i*ty, n.; pl. Velocities. Etym: [L. velocitas, from velox, -
ocis, swift, quick; perhaps akin to v to fly (see Volatile): cf. F.
vélocité.]

1. Quickness of motion; swiftness; speed; celerity; rapidity; as, the
velocity of wind; the velocity of a planet or comet in its orbit or
course; the velocity of a cannon ball; the velocity of light.

Note: In such phrases, velocity is more generally used than celerity.
We apply celerity to animals; as, a horse or an ostrich runs with
celerity; but bodies moving in the air or in ethereal space move with
greater or less velocity, not celerity. This usage is arbitrary, and
perhaps not universal.

2. (Mech.)

Defn: Rate of motion; the relation of motion to time, measured by the
number of units of space passed over by a moving body or point in a
unit of time, usually the number of feet passed over in a second. See
the Note under Speed. Angular velocity. See under Angular.
 -- Initial velocity, the velocity of a moving body at starting;
especially, the velocity of a projectile as it leaves the mouth of a
firearm from which it is discharged.
 -- Relative velocity, the velocity with which a body approaches or
recedes from another body, whether both are moving or only one.
 -- Uniform velocity, velocity in which the same number of units of
space are described in each successive unit of time.
 -- Variable velocity, velocity in which the space described varies
from instant, either increasing or decreasing; -- in the former case
called accelerated velocity, in the latter, retarded velocity; the
acceleration or retardation itself being also either uniform or
variable.
 -- Virtual velocity. See under Virtual.

Note: In variable velocity, the velocity, strictly, at any given
instant, is the rate of motion at that instant, and is expressed by
the units of space, which, if the velocity at that instant were
continued uniform during a unit of time, would be described in the
unit of time; thus, the velocity of a falling body at a given instant
is the number of feet which, if the motion which the body has at that
instant were continued uniformly for one second, it would pass
through in the second. The scientific sense of velocity differs from
the popular sense in being applied to all rates of motion, however
slow, while the latter implies more or less rapidity or quickness of
motion.

Syn.
 -- Swiftness; celerity; rapidity; fleetness; speed.

Ver"te*bra, n.; pl. Vertebræ. Etym: [L. vertebra, fr. vertere to

1. (Anat.)

Defn: One of the serial segments of the spinal column.

Note: In many fishes the vertebræ are simple cartilaginous disks or
short cylinders, but in the higher vertebrates they are composed of
many parts, and the vertebræ in different portions of the same column
vary very greatly. A well-developed vertebra usually consists of a
more or less cylindrical and solid body, or centrum, which is
surmounted dorsally by an arch, leaving an opening which forms a part
of the canal containing the spinal cord. From this dorsal, or neural,
arch spring various processes, or apophyses, which have received
special names: a dorsal, or neural, spine, spinous process, or
neurapophysis, on the middle of the arch; two anterior and two
posterior articular processes, or zygapophyses; and one or two
transverse processes on each side. In those vertebræ which bear well-
developed ribs, a tubercle near the end of the rib articulates at a
tubercular facet on the transverse process (diapophysis), while the
end, or head, of the rib articulates at a more ventral capitular
facet which is sometimes developed into a second, or ventral,
transverse process (parapophysis). In vertebrates with well-developed
hind limbs, the spinal column is divided into five regions in each of
which the vertebræ are specially designated: those vertebræ in front
of, or anterior to, the first vertebra which bears ribs connected
with the sternum are cervical; all those which bear ribs and are back
of the cervicals are dorsal; the one or more directly supporting the
pelvis are sacral and form the sacrum; those between the sacral and
dorsal are lumbar; and all those back of the sacral are caudal, or
coccygeal. In man there are seven cervical vertebræ, twelve dorsal,
five lumbar, five sacral, and usually four, but sometimes five and
rarely three, coccygeal.

VOICE
Voice, n. Etym: [OE. vois, voys, OF. vois, voiz, F. voix, L. vox,
vocis, akin to Gr. vac to say, to speak, G. erwähnen to mention. Cf.
Advocate, Advowson, Avouch, Convoke, Epic, Vocal, Vouch, Vowel.]

1. Sound uttered by the mouth, especially that uttered by human
beings in speech or song; sound thus uttered considered as possessing
some special quality or character; as, the human voice; a pleasant
voice; a low voice.
He with a manly voice saith his message. Chaucer.

2. (Phon.)

Defn: Sound of the kind or quality heard in speech or song in the
consonants b, v, d, etc., and in the vowels; sonant, or intonated,
utterance; tone; -- distinguished from mere breath sound as heard in
f, s, sh, etc., and also whisper.

Note: Voice, in this sense, is produced by vibration of the so-called
vocal cords in the larynx (see Illust. of Larynx) which act upon the
air, not in the manner of the strings of a stringed instrument, but
as a pair of membranous tongues, or reeds, which, being continually
forced apart by the outgoing current of breath, and continually
brought together again by their own elasticity and muscular tension,
break the breath current into a series of puffs, or pulses,
sufficiently rapid to cause the sensation of tone. The power, or
loudness, of such a tone depends on the force of the separate pulses,
and this is determined by the pressure of the expired air, together
with the resistance on the part of the vocal cords which is
continually overcome. Its pitch depends on the number of aërial
pulses within a given time, that is, on the rapidity of their
succession. See Guide to Pronunciation, §§ 5, 146, 155.

3. The tone or sound emitted by anything.

sought for by the governing or "predominant volition." See Will.

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or

Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
