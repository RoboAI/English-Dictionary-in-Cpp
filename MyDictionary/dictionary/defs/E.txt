E

1. The fifth letter of the English alphabet.

Note: It derives its form, name, and value from the Latin, the form
and value being further derived from the Greek, into which it came
from the Phoenician, and ultimately, probably, from the Egyptian. Its
etymological relations are closest with the vowels i, a, and o, as
illustrated by to fall, to fell; man, pl. men; drink, drank, drench;
dint, dent; doom, deem; goose, pl. geese; beef, OF. boef, L. bos; and
E. cheer, OF. chiere, LL. cara.

Note: The letter e has in English several vowel sounds, the two
principal being its long or name sound, as in eve, me, and the short,
as in end, best. Usually at the end of words it is silent, but serves
to indicate that the preceding vowel has its long sound, where
otherwise it would be short, as in mane, as in cane, m, which without
the final e would be pronounced m, c, m. After c and g, the final e
indicates that these letters are to be pronounced as s and j;
respectively, as in lace, rage. See Guide to Pronunciation, §§ 74-97.

2. (Mus.)

Defn: E is the third tone of the model diatonic scale. E (E flat) is

1. Every one of the two or more individuals composing a number of
objects, considered separately from the rest. It is used either with

Note: To each corresponds other. "Let each esteem other better than
himself." Each other, used elliptically for each the other. It is our
duty to assist each other; that is, it is our duty, each to assist
the other, each being in the nominative and other in the objective
case.
It is a bad thing that men should hate each other; but it is far
worse that they should contract the habit of cutting one another's

ausis, Russ. ukho, Gr. audire to hear, Gr. av to favor , protect. Cf.
Auricle, Orillon.]

1. The organ of hearing; the external ear.

Note: In man and the higher vertebrates, the organ of hearing is very
complicated, and is divisible into three parts: the external ear,
which includes the pinna or auricle and meatus or external opening;
the middle ear, drum, or tympanum; and the internal ear, or
labyrinth. The middle ear is a cavity connected by the Eustachian
tube with the pharynx, separated from the opening of the external ear
by the tympanic membrane, and containing a chain of three small
bones, or ossicles, named malleus, incus, and stapes, which connect
this membrane with the internal ear. The essential part of the
internal ear where the fibers of the auditory nerve terminate, is the
membranous labyrinth, a complicated system of sacs and tubes filled
with a fluid (the endolymph), and lodged in a cavity, called the bony
labyrinth, in the periotic bone. The membranous labyrinth does not
completely fill the bony labyrinth, but is partially suspended in it
in a fluid (the perilymph). The bony labyrinth consists of a central
cavity, the vestibule, into which three semicircular canals and the
canal of the cochlea (spirally coiled in mammals) open. The
vestibular portion of the membranous labyrinth consists of two sacs,
the utriculus and sacculus, connected by a narrow tube, into the
former of which three membranous semicircular canals open, while the
latter is connected with a membranous tube in the cochlea containing
the organ of Corti. By the help of the external ear the sonorous
vibrations of the air are concentrated upon the tympanic membrane and
set it vibrating, the chain of bones in the middle ear transmits
these vibrations to the internal ear, where they cause certain
delicate structures in the organ of Corti, and other parts of the
membranous labyrinth, to stimulate the fibers of the auditory nerve
to transmit sonorous impulses to the brain.

2. The sense of hearing; the perception of sounds; the power of
discriminating between different tones; as, a nice ear for music; --
in the singular only.
Songs . . . not all ungrateful to thine ear. Tennyson.

3. That which resembles in shape or position the ear of an animal;
any prominence or projection on an object, -- usually one for support
or attachment; a lug; a handle; as, the ears of a tub, a skillet, or
dish. The ears of a boat are outside kneepieces near the bow. See
Illust. of Bell.

(a) Same as Acroterium (a).
(b) Same as Crossette.

5. Privilege of being kindly heard; favor; attention.

EASTERN CHURCH
Eastern Church.

Defn: That portion of the Christian church which prevails in the
countries once comprised in the Eastern Roman Empire and the
countries converted to Christianity by missionaries from them. Its
full official title is The Orthodox Catholic Apostolic Eastern
Church. It became estranged from the Western, or Roman, Church over
the question of papal supremacy and the doctrine of the filioque, and
a separation, begun in the latter part of the 9th century, became
final in 1054. The Eastern Church consists of twelve (thirteen if the
Bulgarian Church be included) mutually independent churches
(including among these the Hellenic Church, or Church of Greece, and
the Russian Church), using the vernacular (or some ancient form of
it) in divine service and varying in many points of detail, but
standing in full communion with each other and united as equals in a
great federation. The highest five authorities are the patriarch of
Constantinople, or ecumenical patriarch (whose position is not one of
supremacy, but of precedence), the patriarch of Alexandria, the
patriarch of Jerusalem, the patriarch of Antioch, and the Holy Synod
of Russia. The Eastern Church accepts the first seven ecumenical
councils (and is hence styled only schismatic, not heretical, by the
Roman Catholic Church), has as its creed the Niceno-
Constantinopolitan (without the later addition of the filioque,
which, with the doctrine it represents, the church decisively
rejects), baptizes infants with trine immersion, makes confirmation
follow immediately upon baptism, administers the Communion in both
kinds (using leavened bread) and to infants as well as adults,
permits its secular clergy to marry before ordination and to keep
their wives afterward, but not to marry a second time, selects its
bishops from the monastic clergy only, recognizes the offices of
bishop, priest, and deacon as the three necessary degrees of orders,
venerates relics and icons, and has an elaborate ritual.

train of events, something on which it truly depends. A result is
still more remote and variable, like the rebound of an elastic body
which falls in very different directions. We may foresee the effects
of a measure, may conjecture its consequences, but can rarely
discover its final results.

pieces of unlike metals in a bar, and then heating the bar unequally.
(d) Atmospheric electricity, any condition of electrical disturbance
in the atmosphere or clouds, due to some or all of the above
mentioned causes. (e) Magnetic electricity, electricity developed by
the action of magnets. (f) Positive electricity, the electricity that
appears at the positive pole or anode of a battery, or that is

ELEMENT
El"e*ment, n. Etym: [F. élément, L. elementum.]

1. One of the simplest or essential parts or principles of which
anything consists, or upon which the constitution or fundamental
powers of anything are based.

2. One of the ultimate, undecomposable constituents of any kind of
matter. Specifically: (Chem.) A substance which cannot be decomposed
into different kinds of matter by any means at present employed; as,
the elements of water are oxygen and hydrogen.

Note: The elements are naturally classified in several families or
groups, as the group of the alkaline elements, the halogen group, and
the like. They are roughly divided into two great classes, the
metals, as sodium, calcium, etc., which form basic compounds, and the
nonmetals or metalloids, as oxygen, sulphur, chlorine, which form
acid compounds; but the distinction is only relative, and some, as
arsenic, tin, aluminium, etc., form both acid and basic compounds.
The essential fact regarding every element is its relative atomic
weight or equivalent. When the elements are tabulated in the order of
their ascending atomic weights, the arrangement constitutes the
series of the Periodic law of Mendelejeff. See Periodic law, under
Periodic. This Periodic law enables us to predict the qualities of
unknown elements. The number of elements known is about seventy-five,
but the gaps in the Periodic law indicate the possibility of many
more. Many of the elements with which we are familiar, as hydrogen,
carbon, iron, gold, etc., have been recognized, by means of spectrum
analysis, in the sun and the fixed stars. From certain evidence (as
that afforded by the Periodic law, spectrum analysis, etc.) it
appears that the chemical elements probably may not be simple bodies,
but only very stable compounds of some simpler body or bodies. In
formulas, the elements are designated by abbreviations of their names
in Latin or New Latin.

Equity had been gradually shaping itself into a refined science which
no human faculties could master without long and intense application.
Macaulay.

Note: Equitable jurisprudence in England and in the United States
grew up from the inadequacy of common-law forms to secure justice in
all cases; and this led to distinct courts by which equity was
applied in the way of injunctions, bills of discovery, bills for
specified performance, and other processes by which the merits of a
case could be reached more summarily or more effectively than by
common-law suits. By the recent English Judicature Act (1873),
however, the English judges are bound to give effect, in common-law
suits, to all equitable rights and remedies; and when the rules of
equity and of common law, in any particular case, conflict, the rules
of equity are to prevail. In many jurisdictions in the United States,
equity and common law are thus blended; in others distinct equity
tribunals are still maintained. See Chancery. Equity of redemption
(Law), the advantage, allowed to a mortgageor, of a certain or
reasonable time to redeem lands mortgaged, after they have been
forfeited at law by the nonpayment of the sum of money due on the
mortgage at the appointed time. Blackstone.

2. (Chem.)

Defn: That comparative quantity by weight of an element which
possesses the same chemical value as other elements, as determined by
actual experiment and reference to the same standard. Specifically:
(a) The comparative proportions by which one element replaces another
in any particular compound; thus, as zinc replaces hydrogen in
hydrochloric acid, their equivalents are 32.5 and 1. (b) The
combining proportion by weight of a substance, or the number
expressing this proportion, in any particular compound; as, the
equivalents of hydrogen and oxygen in water are respectively 1 and 8,
and in hydric dioxide 1 and 16.

Note: This term was adopted by Wollaston to avoid using the
conjectural expression atomic weight, with which, however, for a time
it was practically synonymous. The attempt to limit the term to the
meaning of a universally comparative combining weight failed, because
of the possibility of several compounds of the substances by reason
of the variation in combining power which most elements exhibit. The
equivalent was really identical with, or a multiple of submultiple
of, the atomic weight.

3. (Chem.)

Defn: A combining unit, whether an atom, a radical, or a molecule;
as, in acid salt two or more equivalents of acid unite with one or
more equivalents of base. Mechanical equivalent of heat (Physics),
the number of units of work which the unit of heat can perform; the
mechanical energy which must be expended to raise the temperature of
a unit weight of water from 0º C. to 1º C., or from 32º F. to 33º F.
The term was introduced by Dr. Mayer of Heilbronn. Its value was
found by Joule to be 1390 foot pounds upon the Centigrade, or 772
foot pounds upon the Fahrenheit, thermometric scale, whence it is
often called Joule's equivalent, and represented by the symbol J.
This is equal to 424 kilogram meters (Centigrade scale). A more
recent determination by Professor Rowland gives the value 426.9
kilogram meters, for the latitude of Baltimore.

test." Burke. Equivocal chord (Mus.), a chord which can be resolved

Syn.
 -- Ambiguous; doubtful; uncertain; indeterminate.
 -- Equivocal, Ambiguous. We call an expression ambiguous when it has
one general meaning, and yet contains certain words which may be
taken in two different senses; or certain clauses which can be so
connected with other clauses as to divide the mind between different
views of part of the meaning intended. We call an expression
equivocal when, taken as a whole, it conveys a given thought with
perfect clearness and propriety, and also another thought with equal
propriety and clearness. Such were the responses often given by the
Delphic oracle; as that to Crambiguous is a mere blunder of language;
what is equivocal is usually intended to deceive, though it may occur
at times from mere inadvertence. Equivocation is applied only to
cases where there is a design to deceive.

Es"ti*mate, v. t. [imp. & p. p. Estimated; p. pr. & vb. n.

t.]

1. To judge and form an opinion of the value of, from imperfect data,
-- either the extrinsic (money), or intrinsic (moral), value; to fix
the worth of roughly or in a general way; as, to estimate the value
of goods or land; to estimate the worth or talents of a person.
It is by the weight of silver, and not the name of the piece, that
men estimate commodities and exchange them. Locke.

living. J. C. Shairp.

data, comparison, or experience; to make an estimate of; to calculate
roughly; to rate; as, to estimate the cost of a trip, the number of
feet in a piece of land.

Syn.
 -- To appreciate; value; appraise; prize; rate; esteem; count;
calculate; number.
 -- To Estimate, Esteem. Both these words imply an exercise of the
judgment. Estimate has reference especially to the external relations
of things, such as amount, magnitude, importance, etc. It usually
involves computation or calculation; as, to estimate the loss or gain
of an enterprise. Esteem has reference to the intrinsic or moral
worth of a person or thing. Thus, we esteem a man for his kindness,
or his uniform integrity. In this sense it implies a mingled
sentiment of respect and attachment. We esteem it an honor to live in
a free country. See Appreciate.

ESTIMATE

Defn: A valuing or rating by the mind, without actually measuring,

estimate of the cost of a building, or of the quantity of water in a

J. C. Shairp.

Syn.
 -- Estimate, Estimation, Esteem. The noun estimate, like its verb,
supposes chiefly an exercise of judgment in determining the amount,
importance, or magnitude of things, with their other exterior
relations; as, an estimate of expenses incurred; a true estimate of
life, etc. Esteem is a moral sentiment made up of respect and
attachment, -- the valuation of a person as possessing useful
qualities or real worth. Thus we speak of the esteem of the wise and
good as a thing greatly to be desired. Estimation seems to waver
between the two. In our version of the Scriptures it is used simply
for estimate; as, "If he be poorer than thy estimation." Lev. xxvii.
8. In other cases, it verges toward esteem; as, "I know him to be of
worth and worthy estimation." Shak. It will probably settle down at
last on this latter sense. "Esteem is the value we place upon some
degree of worth. It is higher than simple approbation, which is a
decision of judgment. It is the commencement of affection." Gogan.
No; dear as freedom is, and in my heart's Just estimation prized
above all price. Cowper.

Dark doubts between the promise and event. Young.

Syn.
 -- Incident; occurrence; adventure; issue; result; termination;
consequence; conclusion.
 -- Event, Occurrence, Incident, Circumstance. An event denotes that
which arises from a preceding state of things. Hence we speak or
watching the event; of tracing the progress of events. An occurrence
has no reference to any antecedents, but simply marks that which
meets us in our progress through life, as if by chance, or in the
course of divine providence. The things which thus meet us, if
important, are usually connected with antecedents; and hence event is
the leading term. In the "Declaration of Independence" it is said,
"When, in the cource of human events, it becomes necessary." etc.
Here, occurrences would be out of place. An incident is that which
falls into a state of things to which is does not primarily belong;
as, the incidents of a journey. The term is usually applied to things
of secondary importance. A circumstance is one of the things
surrounding us in our path of life. These may differ greatly in
importance; but they are always outsiders, which operate upon us from
without, exerting greater or less influence according to their
intrinsic importance. A person giving an account of a campaign might
dwell on the leading events which it produced; might mention some of
its striking occurrences; might allude to some remarkable incidents
which attended it; and might give the details of the favorable or
adverse circumstances which marked its progress.

Syn.
 -- Precedent; case; instance.
 -- Example, Instance. The discrimination to be made between these
two words relates to cases in which we give "instances" or "examples"
of things done. An instance denotes the single case then "standing"
before us; if there be others like it, the word does not express this
fact. On the contrary, an example is one of an entire class of like
things, and should be a true representative or sample of that class.
Hence, an example proves a rule or regular course of things; an
instance simply points out what may be true only in the case
presented. A man's life may be filled up with examples of the self-
command and kindness which marked his character, and may present only
a solitary instance of haste or severity. Hence, the word "example"
should never be used to describe what stands singly and alone. We do,
however, sometimes apply the word instance to what is really an
example, because we are not thinking of the latter under this aspect,
but solely as a case which "stands before us." See Precedent.

EXAMPLE
Ex*am"ple, v. t. [imp. & p. p. Exampled; p. pr. & vb. n. Exampling.]

öie, Goth. aug; cf. OSlav. oko, Lish. akis, L. okulus, Gr. , eye, ,
the two eyes, Skr. akshi. Diasy, Ocular, Optic, Eyelet, Ogle.]

1. The organ of sight or vision. In man, and the vertebrates
generally, it is properly the movable ball or globe in the orbit, but
the term often includes the adjacent parts. In most invertebrates the
years are immovable ocelli, or compound eyes made up of numerous
ocelli. See Ocellus. Description of illustration: a b Conjunctiva; c
Cornea; d Sclerotic; e Choroid; f Cillary Muscle; g Cillary Process;
h Iris; i Suspensory Ligament; k Prosterior Aqueous Chamber between h
and i; l Anterior Aqueous Chamber; m Crystalline Lens; n Vitreous
Humor; o Retina; p Yellow spot; q Center of blind spot; r Artery of
Retina in center of the Optic Nerve.

Note: The essential parts of the eye are inclosed in a tough outer
coat, the sclerotic, to which the muscles moving it are attached, and
which in front changes into the transparent cornea. A little way back
of cornea, the crystalline lens is suspended, dividing the eye into
two unequal cavities, a smaller one in front filled with a watery
fluid, the aqueous humor, and larger one behind filled with a clear
jelly, the vitreous humor. The sclerotic is lined with a highly
pigmented membrane, the choroid, and this is turn is lined in the
back half of the eyeball with the nearly transparent retina, in which
the fibers of the optic nerve ramify. The choroid in front is
continuous with the iris, which has a contractile opening in the
center, the pupil, admitting light to the lens which brings the rays
to a focus and forms an image upon the retina, where the light,
falling upon delicate structures called rods and cones, causes them
to stimulate the fibres of the optic nerve to transmit visual
impressions to the brain.

2. The faculty of seeing; power or range of vision; hence, judgment
or taste in the use of the eye, and in judging of objects; as, to
have the eye of sailor; an eye for the beautiful or picturesque.

knowledge; judgment; opinion.

face; front; the presence of an object which is directly opposed or
confronted; immediate presence.

Her shell your hear disproved to her eyes. Shak.

5. Observation; oversight; watch; inspection; notice; attention;
regard. "Keep eyes upon her." Shak.
Booksellers . . . have an eye to their own advantage. Addison.

6. That which resembles the organ of sight, in form, position, or
appearance; as:
(a) (Zoöl.) The spots on a feather, as of peacock.
(b) The scar to which the adductor muscle is attached in oysters and
other bivalve shells; also, the adductor muscle itself, esp. when

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
