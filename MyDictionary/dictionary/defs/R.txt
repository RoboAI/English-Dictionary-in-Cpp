R
R (är).

Defn: R, the eighteenth letter of the English alphabet, is a vocal
consonant.  It is sometimes called a semivowel, and a liquid. See
Guide to Pronunciation, §§ 178, 179, and 250-254. "R is the dog's
letter and hurreth in the sound."  B. Jonson.

In words derived from the Greek language the letter h is generally
written after r to represent the aspirated sound of the Greek "r, but
does not affect the pronunciation of the English word, as rhapsody,
rhetoric.

The English letter derives its form from the Greek through the Latin,
the Greek letter being derived from the Phonician, which, it is
believed, is ultimately of Egyptian origin. Etymologically, R is most
closely related to l, s, and n; as in bandore, mandole; purple, L.
purpura; E. chapter, F. chapitre, L. capitulum; E. was, were; hare,
G. hase; E. order, F. ordre, L. ordo, ordinis; E. coffer, coffin.

Syn.
 -- Primitive; original; natural; underived; fundamental; entire.
 -- Radical, Entire. These words are frequently employed as
interchangeable in describing some marked alternation in the
condition of things. There is, however, an obvious difference between
them. A radical cure, reform, etc., is one which goes to the root of
the thing in question; and it is entire, in the sense that, by
affecting the root, it affects in a appropriate degree the entire
body nourished by the root; but it may not be entire in the sense of
making a change complete in its nature, as well as in its extent.
Hence, we speak of a radical change; a radical improvement; radical
differences of opinion; while an entire change, an entire
improvement, an entire difference of opinion, might indicate more
than was actually intended. A certain change may be both radical and
entire, in every sense.

and poetry. Cleland.

Radium preparations are remarkable for maintaining themselves at a
higher temperature than their surroundings, and for their radiations,
which are of three kinds: alpha rays, beta rays, and gamma rays (see
these terms). By reason of these rays they ionize gases, affect
photographic plates, cause sores on the skin, and produce many other
striking effects. Their degree of activity depends on the proportion
of radium present, but not on its state of chemical combination or on
external conditions.The radioactivity of radium is therefore an
atomic property, and is explained as result from a disintegration of
the atom. This breaking up occurs in at least seven stages; the
successive main products have been studied and are called radium
emanation or exradio, radium A, radium B, radium C, etc. (The
emanation is a heavy gas, the later products are solids.) These
products are regarded as unstable elements, each with an atomic
weight a little lower than its predecessor. It is possible that lead
is the stable end product. At the same time the light gas helium is
formed; it probably consists of the expelled alpha particles. The
heat effect mentioned above is ascribed to the impacts of these
particles. Radium, in turn, is believed to be formed indirectly by an
immeasurably slow disintegration of uranium.

His reasoning was sufficiently profound. Macaulay.

Syn.
 -- Argumentation; argument.
 -- Reasoning, Argumentation. Few words are more interchanged than
these; and yet, technically, there is a difference between them.
Reasoning is the broader term, including both deduction and
induction. Argumentation denotes simply the former, and descends from
the whole to some included part; while reasoning embraces also the
latter, and ascends from a part to a whole. See Induction. Reasoning
is occupied with ideas and their relations; argumentation has to do
with the forms of logic. A thesis is set down: you attack, I defend
it; you insist, I prove; you distinguish, I destroy your
distinctions; my replies balance or overturn your objections. Such is
argumentation. It supposes that there are two sides, and that both
agree to the same rules. Reasoning, on the other hand, is often a
natural process, by which we form, from the general analogy of
nature, or special presumptions in the case, conclusions which have
greater or less degrees of force, and which may be strengthened or
weakened by subsequent experience.

Re*frac"tion (r*frk"shn), n. Etym: [F. réfraction.]

1. The act of refracting, or the state of being refracted.

2. The change in the direction of ray of light, heat, or the like,
when it enters obliquely a medium of a different density from that
through which it has previously moved.
Refraction out of the rarer medium into the denser, is made towards
the perpendicular. Sir I. Newton.

3. (Astron.)
(a) The change in the direction of a ray of light, and, consequently,
in the apparent position of a heavenly body from which it emanates,
arising from its passage through the earth's atmosphere; -- hence
distinguished as atmospheric refraction, or astronomical refraction.
(b) The correction which is to be deducted from the apparent altitude
of a heavenly body on account of atmospheric refraction, in order to
obtain the true altitude. Angle of refraction (Opt.), the angle which
a refracted ray makes with the perpendicular to the surface
separating the two media traversed by the ray.
 -- Conical refraction (Opt.), the refraction of a ray of light into
an infinite number of rays, forming a hollow cone. This occurs when a
ray of light is passed through crystals of some substances, under
certain circumstances. Conical refraction is of two kinds; external
conical refraction, in which the ray issues from the crystal in the
form of a cone, the vertex of which is at the point of emergence; and
internal conical refraction, in which the ray is changed into the
form of a cone on entering the crystal, from which it issues in the
form of a hollow cylinder. This singular phenomenon was first
discovered by Sir W. R. Hamilton by mathematical reasoning alone,
unaided by experiment.
 -- Differential refraction (Astron.), the change of the apparent
place of one object relative to a second object near it, due to
refraction; also, the correction required to be made to the observed
relative places of the two bodies.
 -- Double refraction (Opt.), the refraction of light in two
directions, which produces two distinct images. The power of double
refraction is possessed by all crystals except those of the isometric
system. A uniaxial crystal is said to be optically positive (like
quartz), or optically negative (like calcite), or to have positive,
or negative, double refraction, according as the optic axis is the
axis of least or greatest elasticity for light; a biaxial crystal is
similarly designated when the same relation holds for the acute
bisectrix.
 -- Index of refraction. See under Index.
 -- Refraction circle (Opt.), an instrument provided with a graduated
circle for the measurement of refraction.
 -- Refraction of latitude, longitude, declination, right ascension,
etc., the change in the apparent latitude, longitude, etc., of a
heavenly body, due to the effect of atmospheric refraction.
 -- Terrestrial refraction, the change in the apparent altitude of a
distant point on or near the earth's surface, as the top of a
mountain, arising from the passage of light from it to the eye
through atmospheric strata of varying density.

REFRACTIVE
Re*fract"ive (r*frkt"v), a. Etym: [Cf. F. réfractif. See Refract.]

Defn: Serving or having power to refract, or turn from a direct

religion. Paley.

Note: Religion, as distinguished from theology, is subjective,
designating the feelings and acts of men which relate to God; while
theology is objective, and denotes those ideas which man entertains
respecting the God whom he worships, especially his systematized
views of God. As distinguished from morality, religion denotes the
influences and motives to human duty which are found in the character
and will of God, while morality describes the duties to man, to which
true religion always influences. As distinguished from piety,
religion is a high sense of moral obligation and spirit of reverence
or worship which affect the heart of man with respect to the Deity,
while piety, which first expressed the feelings of a child toward a
parent, is used for that filial sentiment of veneration and love
which we owe to the Father of all. As distinguished from sanciti,
religion is the means by which sanctity is achieved, sanctity
denoting primarily that purity of heart and life which results from
habitual communion with God, and a sense of his continual presence.
Natural religion, a religion based upon the evidences of a God and
his qualities, which is supplied by natural phenomena. See Natural
theology, under Natural.
 -- Religion of humanity, a name sometimes given to a religion

 -- Revealed religion, that which is based upon direct communication
of God's will to mankind; especially, the Christian religion, based
on the revelations recorded in the Old and New Testaments.

Till Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane, I can not taint with fear.
Shak.

Note: The verb remove, in some of its application, is synonymous with
move, but not in all. Thus we do not apply remove to a mere change of
posture, without a change of place or the seat of a thing. A man
moves his head when he turns it, or his finger when he bends it, but
he does not remove it. Remove usually or always denotes a change of
place in a body, but we never apply it to a regular, continued course
or motion. We never say the wind or water, or a ship, removes at a
certain rate by the hour; but we say a ship was removed from one
place in a harbor to another. Move is a generic term, including the
sense of remove, which is more generally applied to a change from one
station or permanent position, stand, or seat, to another station.

ROMAN CALENDAR
Roman calendar.

Defn: The calendar of the ancient Romans, from which our modern
calendars are derived. It is said to have consisted originally of ten
months, Martius, Aprilis, Maius, Junius, Quintilis, Sextilis,
September, October, November, and December, having a total of 304
days. Numa added two months, Januarius at the beginning of the year,
and Februarius at the end, making in all 355 days. He also ordered an
intercalary month, Mercedinus, to be inserted every second year.
Later the order of the months was changed so that January should come
before February. Through abuse of power by the pontiffs to whose care
it was committed, this calendar fell into confusion. It was replaced
by the Julian calendar. In designating the days of the month, the
Romans reckoned backward from three fixed points, the calends, the
nones, and the ides. The calends were always the first day of the
month. The ides fell on the 15th in March, May, July (Quintilis), and
October, and on the 13th in other months. The nones came on the
eighth day (the ninth, counting the ides) before the ides. Thus, Jan.
13 was called the ides of January, Jan. 12, the day before the ides,
and Jan. 11, the third day before the ides (since the ides count as
one), while Jan. 14 was the 19th day before the calends of February.

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
