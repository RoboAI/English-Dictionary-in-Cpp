moneyed, landed, lilied, honeyed, and numerous other adjectives

have two sticks, or one stick cleft into two parts, and to mark with
a score or notch, on each, the number or quantity of goods delivered,
-- the seller keeping one stick, and the purchaser the other. Before
the use of writing, this, or something like it, was the only method
of keeping accounts; and tallies were received as evidence in courts
of justice. In the English exchequer were tallies of loans, one part
being kept in the exchequer, the other being given to the creditor in

 -- Savor; relish; flavor; sensibility; gout.
 -- Taste, Sensibility, Judgment. Some consider taste as a mere
sensibility, and others as a simple exercise of judgment; but a union
of both is requisite to the existence of anything which deserves the
name. An original sense of the beautiful is just as necessary to
æsthetic judgments, as a sense of right and wrong to the formation of
any just conclusions or moral subjects. But this "sense of the
beautiful" is not an arbitrary principle. It is under the guidance of
reason; it grows in delicacy and correctness with the progress of the
individual and of society at large; it has its laws, which are seated
in the nature of man; and it is in the development of these laws that
we find the true "standard of taste."
What, then, is taste, but those internal powers, Active and strong,
and feelingly alive To each fine impulse a discerning sense Of decent
and sublime, with quick disgust From things deformed, or disarranged,
or gross In species This, nor gems, nor stores of gold, Nor purple
state, nor culture, can bestow, But God alone, when first his active
hand Imprints the secret bias of the soul. Akenside.

modified epithelial cells arranged somewhat like leaves in a bud.

TEA
Tea, n. Etym: [Chin. tsha, Prov. Chin. te: cf. F. thé.]

1. The prepared leaves of a shrub, or small tree (Thea, or Camellia,
Chinensis). The shrub is a native of China, but has been introduced
to some extent into some other countries.

Note: Teas are classed as green or black, according to their color or
appearance, the kinds being distinguished also by various other
characteristic differences, as of taste, odor, and the like. The
color, flavor, and quality are dependent upon the treatment which the
leaves receive after being gathered. The leaves for green tea are
heated, or roasted slightly, in shallow pans over a wood fire, almost
immediately after being gathered, after which they are rolled with
the hands upon a table, to free them from a portion of their
moisture, and to twist them, and are then quickly dried. Those
intended for black tea are spread out in the air for some time after
being gathered, and then tossed about with the hands until they
become soft and flaccid, when they are roasted for a few minutes, and
rolled, and having then been exposed to the air for a few hours in a
soft and moist state, are finally dried slowly over a charcoal fire.
The operation of roasting and rolling is sometimes repeated several
times, until the leaves have become of the proper color. The
principal sorts of green tea are Twankay, the poorest kind; Hyson
skin, the refuse of Hyson; Hyson, Imperial, and Gunpowder, fine
varieties; and Young Hyson, a choice kind made from young leaves
gathered early in the spring. Those of black tea are Bohea, the
poorest kind; Congou; Oolong; Souchong, one of the finest varieties;
and Pekoe, a fine-flavored kind, made chiefly from young spring buds.
See Bohea, Congou, Gunpowder tea, under Gunpowder, Hyson, Oolong, and
Souchong. K. Johnson. Tomlinson.

Note: "No knowledge of . . . [tea] appears to have reached Europe
till after the establishment of intercourse between Portugal and
China in 1517. The Portuguese, however, did little towards the
introduction of the herb into Europe, and it was not till the Dutch
established themselves at Bantam early in 17th century, that these
adventurers learned from the Chinese the habit of tea drinking, and
brought it to Europe." Encyc. Brit.

TELEPHONE
Tel"e*phone, n. Etym: [Gr. (Physics)

Defn: An instrument for reproducing sounds, especially articulate
speech, at a distance.

Note: The ordinary telephone consists essentially of a device by
which currents of electricity, produced by sounds through the agency
of certain mechanical devices and exactly corresponding in duration
and intensity to the vibrations of the air which attend them, are
transmitted to a distant station, and there, acting on suitable
mechanism, reproduce similar sounds by repeating the vibrations. The
necessary variations in the electrical currents are usually produced
by means of a microphone attached to a thin diaphragm upon which the
voice acts, and are intensified by means of an induction coil. In the
magnetic telephone, or magneto-telephone, the diaphragm is of soft
iron placed close to the pole of a magnet upon which is wound a coil
of fine wire, and its vibrations produce corresponding vibrable
currents in the wire by induction. The mechanical, or string,
telephone is a device in which the voice or sound causes vibrations
in a thin diaphragm, which are directly transmitted along a wire or
string connecting it to a similar diaphragm at the remote station,
thus reproducing the sound. It does not employ electricity.

TELESCOPE
Tel"e*scope, n. Etym: [Gr. télescope. See Telegraph, and -scope.]

Defn: An optical instrument used in viewing distant objects, as the

Note: A telescope assists the eye chiefly in two ways; first, by
enlarging the visual angle under which a distant object is seen, and
thus magnifying that object; and, secondly, by collecting, and
conveying to the eye, a larger beam of light than would enter the
naked organ, thus rendering objects distinct and visible which would
otherwise be indistinct and or invisible. Its essential parts are the
object glass, or concave mirror, which collects the beam of light,
and forms an image of the object, and the eyeglass, which is a
microscope, by which the image is magnified. Achromatic telescope.
See under Achromatic.
 -- Aplanatic telescope, a telescope having an aplanatic eyepiece.

Cassegrain, which differs from the Gregorian only in having the
secondary speculum convex instead of concave, and placed nearer the
large speculum. The Cassegrainian represents objects inverted; the

Illust. under Reflecting telescope, below) is a Cassegrainian
telescope.
 -- Dialytic telescope. See under Dialytic. Equatorial telescope. See
the Note under Equatorial.
 -- Galilean telescope, a refracting telescope in which the eyeglass
is a concave instead of a convex lens, as in the common opera glass.

of the instrument. It exhibits the objects erect, that is, in their
natural positions.
 -- Gregorian telescope, a form of reflecting telescope. See under
Gregorian.
 -- Herschelian telescope, a reflecting telescope of the form
invented by Sir William Herschel, in which only one speculum is
employed, by means of which an image of the object is formed near one
side of the open end of the tube, and to this the eyeglass is applied
directly.
 -- Newtonian telescope, a form of reflecting telescope. See under
Newtonian.
 -- Photographic telescope, a telescope specially constructed to make
photographs of the heavenly bodies.
 -- Prism telescope. See Teinoscope.
 -- Reflecting telescope, a telescope in which the image is formed by
a speculum or mirror (or usually by two speculums, a large one at the
lower end of the telescope, and the smaller one near the open end)
instead of an object glass. See Gregorian, Cassegrainian,
Herschelian, and Newtonian, telescopes, above.
 -- Refracting telescope, a telescope in which the image is formed by
refraction through an object glass.
 -- Telescope carp (Zoöl.), the telescope fish.
 -- Telescope fish (Zoöl.), a monstrous variety of the goldfish

 -- Telescope sight (Firearms), a slender telescope attached to the
barrel, having cross wires in the eyepiece and used as a sight.
 -- Terrestrial telescope, a telescope whose eyepiece has one or two
lenses more than the astronomical, for the purpose of inverting the
image, and exhibiting objects erect.

term is more select and dignified; the Anglo-Saxon more familiar and
energetic. We show temerity in hasty decisions, and the conduct to
which they lead. We show rashness in particular actions, as dictated
by sudden impulse. It is an exhibition of temerity to approach the
verge of a precipice; it is an act of rashness to jump into a river
without being able to swim. Temerity, then, is an unreasonable
contempt of danger; rashness is a rushing into danger from
thoughtlessness or excited feeling.

6. (Logic)

Defn: The subject or the predicate of a proposition; one of the three
component parts of a syllogism, each one of which is used twice.
The subject and predicate of a proposition are, after Aristotle,
together called its terms or extremes. Sir W. Hamilton.

Note: The predicate of the conclusion is called the major term,
because it is the most general, and the subject of the conclusion is
called the minor term, because it is less general. These are called
the extermes; and the third term, introduced as a common measure
between them, is called the mean or middle term. Thus in the
following syllogism, --Every vegetable is combustible; Every tree is
a vegetable; Therefore every tree is combustible, -combustible, the
predicate of the conclusion, is the major term; tree is the minor
term; vegetable is the middle term.

Syn.
 -- Limit; bound; boundary; condition; stipulation; word; expression.
 -- Term, Word. These are more frequently interchanged than almost
any other vocables that occur of the language. There is, however, a
difference between them which is worthy of being kept in mind. Word
is generic; it denotes an utterance which represents or expresses our
thoughts and feelings. Term originally denoted one of the two
essential members of a proposition in logic, and hence signifies a
word of specific meaning, and applicable to a definite class of
objects. Thus, we may speak of a scientific or a technical term, and
of stating things in distinct terms. Thus we say, "the term minister
literally denotes servant;" "an exact definition of terms is
essential to clearness of thought;" "no term of reproach can
sufficiently express my indignation;" "every art has its peculiar and
distinctive terms," etc. So also we say, "purity of style depends on
the choice of words, and precision of style on a clear understanding
of the terms used." Term is chiefly applied to verbs, nouns, and
adjectives, these being capable of standing as terms in a logical
proposition; while prepositions and conjunctions, which can never be
so employed, are rarely spoken of as terms, but simply as words.

Syn.
 -- Criterion; standard; experience; proof; experiment; trial.
 -- Test, Trial. Trial is the wider term; test is a searching and
decisive trial. It is derived from the Latin testa (earthen pot),
which term was early applied to the fining pot, or crucible, in which
metals are melted for trial and refinement. Hence the peculiar force
of the word, as indicating a trial or criterion of the most decisive
kind.
I leave him to your gracious acceptance, whose trial shall better
publish his commediation. Shak.
Thy virtue, prince, has stood the test of fortune, Like purest gold,
that tortured in the furnace, Comes out more bright, and brings forth
all its weight. Addison.

Syn.
 -- Proof; evidence; attestation; witness; affirmation; confirmation;

 -- Testimony, Proof, Evidence. Proof is the most familiar, and is
used more frequently (though not exclusively) of facts and things
which occur in the ordinary concerns of life. Evidence is a word of
more dignity, and is more generally applied to that which is moral or
intellectual; as, the evidences of Christianity, etc. Testimony is
what is deposed to by a witness on oath or affirmation. When used
figuratively or in a wider sense, the word testimony has still a
reference to some living agent as its author, as when we speak of the
testimony of conscience, or of doing a thing in testimony of our
affection, etc. Testimony refers rather to the thing declared,
evidence to its value or effect. "To conform our language more to
common use, we ought to divide arguments into demonstrations, proofs,
and probabilities; ba proofs, meaning such arguments from experience
as leave no room for doubt or opposition." Hume. "The evidence of
sense is the first and highest kind of evidence of which human nature
is capable." Bp. Wilkins. "The proof of everything must be by the
testimony of such as the parties produce." Spenser.

th\'91t is akin to D. dat, G. das, OHG. daz, Sw. & Dan. det, Icel.
Þat (masc. sa, fem. so), Goth. Þata (masc. sa, fem. so), Gr. tat (for
tad, masc. sas, fem. sa); cf. L. istud that. *184. Cf. The, Their,
They, Them, This, Than, Since.]

1. As a demonstrative pronoun (pl. Those), that usually points out,
or refers to, a person or thing previously mentioned, or supposed to
be understood. That, as a demonstrative, may precede the noun to
which it refers; as, that which he has said is true; those in the
basket are good apples.

with the wicked. Gen. xviii. 25.

ceci, generally refers to that which is nearer, and that, like Latin
ille and French cela, to that which is more remote. When they refer
to foreign words or phrases, this generally refers to the latter, and
that to the former.
Two principles in human nature reign; Self-love, to urge, and Reason,
to restrain; Nor this a good, nor that a bad we call. Pope.

alluded to, before, and may be either singular or plural.

A judgment that is equal and impartial must incline to the greater
probabilities. Bp. Wilkins.

Note: If the relative clause simply conveys an additional idea, and
is not properly explanatory or restrictive, who or which (rarely
that) is employed; as, the king that (or who) rules well is generally
popular; Victoria, who (not that) rules well, enjoys the confidence
of her subjects. Ambiguity may in some cases be avoided in the use of
that (which is restrictive) instead of who or which, likely to be
understood in a coördinating sense. Bain. That was formerly used for
that which, as what is now; but such use is now archaic.

him wirche [work]. Chaucer.

cut off. Zech. xi. 9.

verb, or as the subject or predicate nominative of a verb.
She tells them 't is a causeless fantasy, And childish error, that
they are afraid. Shak.

frequently preceded by so, in order, to the end, etc.

conjunction on which it depends.

2. The alternate rising and falling of the waters of the ocean, and
of bays, rivers, etc., connected therewith. The tide ebbs and flows
twice in each lunar day, or the space of a little more than twenty-
four hours. It is occasioned by the attraction of the sun and moon
(the influence of the latter being three times that of the former),
acting unequally on the waters in different parts of the earth, thus
disturbing their equilibrium. A high tide upon one side of the earth
is accompanied by a high tide upon the opposite side. Hence, when the
sun and moon are in conjunction or opposition, as at new moon and
full moon, their action is such as to produce a greater than the
usual tide, called the spring tide, as represented in the cut. When
the moon is in the first or third quarter, the sun's attraction in
part counteracts the effect of the moon's attraction, thus producing
under the moon a smaller tide than usual, called the neap tide.

Note: The flow or rising of the water is called flood tide, and the
reflux, ebb tide.

3. A stream; current; flood; as, a tide of blood. "Let in the tide of
knaves once more; my cook and I'll provide." Shak.

 -- Tide day, the interval between the occurrences of two consecutive
maxima of the resultant wave at the same place. Its length varies as
the components of sun and moon waves approach to, or recede from, one
another. A retardation from this cause is called the lagging of the
tide, while the acceleration of the recurrence of high water is
termed the priming of the tide. See Lag of the tide, under 2d Lag.
 -- Tide dial, a dial to exhibit the state of the tides at any time.
 -- Tide gate. (a) An opening through which water may flow freely

To- (, see To, prep.) Etym: [AS. to- asunder; akin to G. zer-, and
perhaps to L. dis-, or Gr.

Defn: An obsolete intensive prefix used in the formation of compound
verbs; as in to-beat, to-break, to-hew, to-rend, to-tear. See these
words in the Vocabulary. See the Note on All to, or All-to, under
All, adv.

TO
To (emphatic or alone, obscure or unemphatic), prep. Etym: [AS. to;
akin to OS. & OFries. to, D. toe, G. zu, OHG. zuo, zua, zo, Russ. do,
Ir. & Gael. do, OL. -do, -du, as in endo, indu, in, Gr. Too, Tatoo a
beat of drums.]

1. The preposition to primarily indicates approach and arrival,
motion made in the direction of a place or thing and attaining it,
access; and also, motion or tendency without arrival; movement
toward; -- opposed to Ant: from. "To Canterbury they wend." Chaucer.
Stay with us, go not to Wittenberg. Shak.
So to the sylvan lodge They came, that like Pomona's arbor smiled.
Milton.
I'll to him again, . . . He'll tell me all his purpose. She stretched
her arms to heaven. Dryden.

2. Hence, it indicates motion, course, or tendency toward a time, a
state or condition, an aim, or anything capable of being regarded as
a limit to a tendency, movement, or action; as, he is going to a
trade; he is rising to wealth and honor.

Note: Formerly, by omission of the verb denoting motion, to sometimes
followed a form of be, with the sense of at, or in. "When the sun was
[gone or declined] to rest." Chaucer.

3. In a very general way, and with innumerable varieties of
application, to connects transitive verbs with their remoter or
indirect object, and adjectives, nouns, and neuter or passive verbs
with a following noun which limits their action. Its sphere verges
upon that of for, but it contains less the idea of design or
appropriation; as, these remarks were addressed to a large audience;
let us keep this seat to ourselves; a substance sweet to the taste;
an event painful to the mind; duty to God and to our parents; a
dislike to spirituous liquor.
Marks and points out each man of us to slaughter. B. Jonson.
Whilst they, distilled Almost to jelly with the act of fear, Stand
dumb and speak not to him. Shak.
Add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; and to knowledge
temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;
and to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness
charity. 2 Pet. i. 5,6,7.
I have a king's oath to the contrary. Shak.
Numbers were crowded to death. Clarendon.
Fate and the dooming gods are deaf to tears. Dryden.
Go, buckle to the law. Dryden.

4. As sign of the infinitive, to had originally the use of last
defined, governing the infinitive as a verbal noun, and connecting it
as indirect object with a preceding verb or adjective; thus, ready to
go, i.e., ready unto going; good to eat, i.e., good for eating; I do
my utmost to lead my life pleasantly. But it has come to be the
almost constant prefix to the infinitive, even in situations where it
has no prepositional meaning, as where the infinitive is direct
object or subject; thus, I love to learn, i.e., I love learning; to
die for one's country is noble, i.e., the dying for one's country.
Where the infinitive denotes the design or purpose, good usage
formerly allowed the prefixing of for to the to; as, what went ye out
for see (Matt. xi. 8).
Then longen folk to go on pilgrimages, And palmers for to seeken
strange stranders. Chaucer.

Note: Such usage is now obsolete or illiterate. In colloquial usage,
to often stands for, and supplies, an infinitive already mentioned;
thus, he commands me to go with him, but I do not wish to.

5. In many phrases, and in connection with many other words, to has a
pregnant meaning, or is used elliptically. Thus, it denotes or
implies:
(a) Extent; limit; degree of comprehension; inclusion as far as; as,
they met us to the number of three hundred.
We ready are to try our fortunes To the last man. Shak.
Few of the Esquimaux can count to ten. Quant. Rev.

(b) Effect; end; consequence; as, the prince was flattered to his
ruin; he engaged in a war to his cost; violent factions exist to the
prejudice of the state.
(c) Apposition; connection; antithesis; opposition; as, they engaged
hand to hand.
Now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face. 1 Cor.
xiii. 12.

(d) Accord; adaptation; as, an occupation to his taste; she has a
husband to her mind.
He to God's image, she to his was made. Dryden.

(e) Comparison; as, three is to nine as nine is to twenty-seven; it
is ten to one that you will offend him.
All that they did was piety to this. B. Jonson.

(f) Addition; union; accumulation.
Wisdom he has, and to his wisdom, courage. Denham.

(g) Accompaniment; as, she sang to his guitar; they danced to the
music of a piano.
Anon they move In perfect phalanx to the Dorian mood Of flutes and
soft recorders. Milton.

(h) Character; condition of being; purpose subserved or office
filled. [In this sense archaic] "I have a king here to my flatterer."
Shak.
Made his masters and others . . . to consider him to a little wonder.
Walton.

Note: To in to-day, to-night, and to-morrow has the sense or force of
for or on; for, or on, (this) day, for, or on, (this) night, for, or
on, (the) morrow. To-day, to-night, to-morrow may be considered as
compounds, and usually as adverbs; but they are sometimes used as
nouns; as, to-day is ours.
To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow; Creeps in this petty pace
from day to day. Shak.
To and again, to and fro. [R.] -- To and fro, forward and back. In
this phrase, to is adverbial.
There was great showing both to and fro. Chaucer.
-- To-and-fro, a pacing backward and forward; as, to commence a to-
and-fro. Tennyson.
 -- To the face, in front of; in behind; hence, in the presence of.
 -- To wit, to know; namely. See Wit, v. i.

Note: To, without an object expressed, is used adverbially; as, put
to the door, i. e., put the door to its frame, close it; and in the
nautical expressions, to heave to, to come to, meaning to a certain
position. To, like on, is sometimes used as a command, forward, set
to. "To, Achilles! to, Ajax! to!" Shak.

Note: The use of the word tone, both for a sound and for the interval

universal.

Note: Nearly every musical sound is composite, consisting of several
simultaneous tones having different rates of vibration according to
fixed laws, which depend upon the nature of the vibrating body and
the mode of excitation. The components (of a composite sound) are
called partial tones; that one having the lowest rate of vibration is
the fundamental tone, and the other partial tones are called
harmonics, or overtones. The vibration ratios of the partial tones
composing any sound are expressed by all, or by a part, of the
numbers in the series 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.; and the quality of any
sound (the tone color) is due in part to the presence or absence of
overtones as represented in this series, and in part to the greater
or less intensity of those present as compared with the fundamental
tone and with one another. Resultant tones, combination tones,
summation tones, difference tones, Tartini's tones (terms only in
part synonymous) are produced by the simultaneous sounding of two or
more primary (simple or composite) tones.

is either foreign or domestic. Foreign trade consists in the

exchange, or buying and selling, of goods within a country. Trade is
also by the wholesale, that is, by the package or in large

on the north side of the equator, and from S. E. to N. W. on the
south side of the equator. They are produced by the joint effect of
the rotation of the earth and the movement of the air from the polar
toward the equatorial regions, to supply the vacancy caused by
heating, rarefaction, and consequent ascent of the air in the latter
regions. The trade winds are principally limited to two belts in the
tropical regions, one on each side of the equator, and separated by a
belt which is characterized by calms or variable weather.

Defn: In the Kantian system, of or pertaining to that which can be

is acquired by experience.

Syn.
 -- Transcendental, Empirical. These terms, with the corresponding
nouns, transcendentalism and empiricism, are of comparatively recent
origin. Empirical refers to knowledge which is gained by the
experience of actual phenomena, without reference to the principles
or laws to which they are to be referred, or by which they are to be
explained. Transcendental has reference to those beliefs or
principles which are not derived from experience, and yet are
absolutely necessary to make experience possible or useful. Such, in
the better sense of the term, is the transcendental philosophy, or
transcendentalism. Each of these words is also used in a bad sense,
empiricism applying to that one-sided view of knowledge which
neglects or loses sight of the truths or principles referred to
above, and trusts to experience alone; transcendentalism, to the
opposite extreme, which, in its deprecation of experience, loses
sight of the relations which facts and phenomena sustain to
principles, and hence to a kind of philosophy, or a use of language,
which is vague, obscure, fantastic, or extravagant.

TRANSCENDENTAL
Tran`scen*den"tal, n.

Defn: A transcendentalist. [Obs.]

transcendentalismus.]

1. (Kantian Philos.)

Defn: The transcending, or going beyond, empiricism, and ascertaining
a priori the fundamental principles of human knowledge.

Note: As Schelling and Hegel claim to have discovered the absolute
identity of the objective and subjective in human knowledge, or of
things and human conceptions of them, the Kantian distinction between
transcendent and transcendental ideas can have no place in their
philosophy; and hence, with them, transcendentalism claims to have a
true knowledge of all things, material and immaterial, human and
divine, so far as the mind is capable of knowing them. And in this
sense the word transcendentalism is now most used. It is also
sometimes used for that which is vague and illusive in philosophy.

2. Ambitious and imaginative vagueness in thought, imagery, or
diction.

cone then developed a smaller cone in front and another behind. Next,
a cingulum was developed, and the three cones became arranged in a
triangle, the two smaller cusps having moved to the outer side in
upper and to the inner in lower molars. This primitive triangle is
called the trigon or trigonid and this stage the tritubercular or
trigonodont. The trigon being a cutting apparatus, an extension of
the posterior part of the crown was developed in lower molars for
crushing, and a smaller corresponding part appeared in upper molars.
Another large cone then arose, usually from the cingulum. In more
complex forms, smaller intermediate cusps appeared.

type bodies (Type Founding), a system adopted by the type founders of
the United States by which the various sizes of type have been so
modified and changed that each size bears an exact proportional
relation to every other size. The system is a modification of a
French system, and is based on the pica body. This pica body is
divided into twelfths, which are termed "points," and every type body
consist of a given number of these points. Many of the type founders
indicate the new sizes of type by the number of points, and the old
names are gradually being done away with. By the point system type
founders cast type of a uniform size and height, whereas formerly
fonts of pica or other type made by different founders would often
vary slightly so that they could not be used together. There are no
type in actual use corresponding to the smaller theoretical sizes of
the point system. In some cases, as in that of ruby, the term used
designates a different size from that heretofore so called.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
