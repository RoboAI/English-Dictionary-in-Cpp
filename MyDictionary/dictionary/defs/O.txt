O

1. O, the fifteenth letter of the English alphabet, derives its form,
value, and name from the Greek O, through the Latin. The letter came
into the Greek from the Phoenician, which possibly derived it
ultimately from the Egyptian. Etymologically, the letter o is most
closely related to a, e, and u; as in E. bone, AS. ban; E. stone, AS.
stan; E. broke, AS. brecan to break; E. bore, AS. beran to bear; E.
dove, AS. dufe; E. toft, tuft; tone, tune; number, F. nombre. The
letter o has several vowel sounds, the principal of which are its
long sound, as in bone, its short sound, as in nod, and the sounds
heard in the words orb, son, do (feod), and wolf (book). In
connection with the other vowels it forms several digraphs and
diphthongs. See Guide to Pronunciation, §§ 107-129.

2. Among the ancients, O was a mark of triple time, from the notion
that the ternary, or number 3, is the most perfect of numbers, and
properly expressed by a circle, the most perfect figure. O was also
anciently used to represent 11: with a dash over it (O
O, n.; pl. O's or Oes (.

1. The letter O, or its sound. "Mouthing out his hollow oes and aes."
Tennyson.

2. Something shaped like the letter O; a circle or oval. "This wooden
O [Globe Theater]". Shak.

3. A cipher; zero. [R.]
Thou art an O without a figure. Shak.

O'
O', Etym: [Ir. of a descendant.]

Defn: A prefix to Irish family names, which signifies grandson or
descendant of, and is a character of dignity; as, O'Neil, O'Carrol.

O'
O', prep.

Defn: A shortened form of of or on. "At the turning o' the tide."
Shak.

O
O, a. Etym: [See One.]

Defn: One. [Obs.] Chaucer. "Alle thre but o God." Piers Plowman.

O
O, interj.

Defn: An exclamation used in calling or directly addressing a person
or personified object; also, as an emotional or impassioned
exclamation expressing pain, grief, surprise, desire, fear, etc.
For ever, O Lord, thy word is settled in heaven. Ps. cxix. 89.
O how love I thy law ! it is my meditation all the day. Ps. cxix. 97.

Note: O is frequently followed by an ellipsis and that, an in
expressing a wish: "O [I wish] that Ishmael might live before thee !"
Gen. xvii. 18; or in expressions of surprise, indignation, or regret:
"O [it is sad] that such eyes should e'er meet other object !"
Sheridan Knowles.

Note: A distinction between the use of O and oh is insisted upon by
some, namely, that O should be used only in direct address to a
person or personified object, and should never be followed by the
exclamation point, while Oh (or oh) should be used in exclamations
where no direct appeal or address to an object is made, and may be
followed by the exclamation point or not, according to the nature or
construction of the sentence. Some insist that oh should be used only
as an interjection expressing strong feeling. The form O, however,
is, it seems, the one most commonly employed for both uses by modern
writers and correctors for the press. "O, I am slain !" Shak. "O what
a fair and ministering angel !" "O sweet angel !" Longfellow.
O for a kindling touch from that pure flame ! Wordsworth.
But she is in her grave, -- and oh The difference to me ! Wordsworth.
Oh for a lodge in some vast wilderness ! Cowper.
We should distinguish between the sign of the vocative and the
emotional interjection, writing O for the former, and oh for the
latter. Earle.
O dear, and O dear me! Etym: [corrupted fr. F. O Dieu! or It. O Dio!
O God! O Dio mio! O my God! Wyman], exclamations expressive of
various emotions, but usually promoted by surprise, consternation,
grief, pain, etc.

OBJECTIVE
Ob*jec"tive, a. Etym: [Cf.F. objectif.]

1. Of or pertaining to an object.

2. (Metaph.)

Defn: Of or pertaining to an object; contained in, or having the
nature or position of, an object; outward; external; extrinsic; -- an
epithet applied to whatever ir exterior to the mind, or which is
simply an object of thought or feeling, and opposed to subjective.
In the Middle Ages, subject meant substance, and has this sense in
Descartes and Spinoza: sometimes, also, in Reid. Subjective is used
by William of Occam to denote that which exists independent of mind;
objective, what is formed by the mind. This shows what is meant by
realitas objectiva in Descartes. Kant and Fichte have inverted the
meanings. Subject, with them, is the mind which knows; object, that
which is known; subjective, the varying conditions of the knowing
mind; objective, that which is in the constant nature of the thing
known. Trendelenburg.
Objective means that which belongs to, or proceeds from, the object
known, and not from the subject knowing, and thus denotes what is
real, in opposition to that which is ideal -- what exists in nature,
in contrast to what exists merely in the thought of the individual.
Sir. W. Hamilton.
Objective has come to mean that which has independent exostence or
authority, apart from our experience or thought. Thus, moral law is
said to have objective authority, that is, authority belonging to
itself, and not drawn from anything in our nature. Calderwood
(Fleming's Vocabulary).

3. (Gram.)

Defn: Pertaining to, or designating, the case which follows a
transitive verb or a preposition, being that case in which the direct
object of the verb is placed. See Accusative, n.

Note: The objective case is frequently used without a governing word,
esp. in designations of time or space, where a preposition, as at,
in, on, etc., may be supplied.
My troublous dream [on] this night make me sad. Shak.
To write of victories [in or for] next year. Hudibras.
Objective line (Perspective), a line drawn on the geometrical plane
which is represented or sought to be represented.
 -- Objective plane (Perspective), any plane in the horizontal plane
that is represented.
 -- Objective point, the point or result to which the operations of
an army are directed. By extension, the point or purpose to which
anything, as a journey or an argument, is directed.

Syn.
 -- Objective, Subjective. Objective is applied to things exterior to
the mind, and objects of its attention; subjective, to the operations
of the mind itself. Hence, an objective motive is some outward thing
awakening desire; a subjective motive is some internal feeling or
propensity. Objective views are those governed by outward things;
subjective views are produced or modified by internal feeling. Sir
Walter Scott's poetry is chiefly objective; that of Wordsworth is
eminently subjective.
In the philosophy of mind, subjective denotes what is to be referred
to the thinking subject, the ego; objective what belongs to the
object of thought, the non-ego. Sir. W. Hamilton

acquire, in any way.
Some pray for riches; riches they obtain. Dryden.
By guileful fair words peace may be obtained. Shak.
It may be that I may obtain children by her. Gen. xvi. 2.

Syn.
 -- To attain; gain; procure; acquire; win; earn. See Attain.
 -- To Obtain, Get, Gain, Earn, Acquire. The idea of getting is
common to all these terms. We may, indeed, with only a slight change
of sense, substitute get for either of them; as, to get or to gain a
prize; to get or to obtain an employment; to get or to earn a living;
to get or to acquire a language. To gain is to get by striving; and
as this is often a part of our good fortune, the word gain is
peculiarly applicable to whatever comes to us fortuitously. Thus, we
gain a victory, we gain a cause, we gain an advantage, etc. To earn
is to deserve by labor or service; as, to earn good wages; to earn a
triumph. Unfortunately, one does not always get or obtain what he has
earned. To obtain implies desire for possession, and some effort
directed to the attainment of that which is not immediately within
our reach. Whatever we thus seek and get, we obtain, whether by our
own exertions or those of others; whether by good or bad means;
whether permanently, or only for a time. Thus, a man obtains an
employment; he obtains an answer to a letter, etc. To acquire is more
limited and specific. We acquire what comes to us gradually in the
regular exercise of our abilities, while we obtain what comes in any
way, provided we desire it. Thus, we acquire knowledge, property,
honor, reputation, etc. What we acquire becomes, to a great extent,
permanently our own; as, to acquire a language; to acquire habits of
industry, etc.

innocence, or by casting the accused person, bound hand and foot,
into a river or pond, when if he floated it was an evidence of guilt,

composition of the word, the orthography was change to make it
represent the u of Gr. 'oxy`s, from which it was supposed to be
directly derived.] (Chem.)

Defn: A binary compound of oxygen with an atom or radical, or a
compound which is regarded as binary; as, iron oxide, ethyl oxide,
nitrogen oxide, etc.

Lavoisier,and their associates, the term oxides was made to include
all compounds of oxygen which had no acid (F. acide) properties, as

(Chem.)

Defn: To combine with oxygen, or subject to the action of oxygen, or
of an oxidizing agent. Specifically:
(a) To combine with oxygen or with more oxygen; to add oxygen to; as,
to oxidize nitrous acid so as to form nitric acid.
(b) To remove hydrogen from (anything), as by the action of oxygen;

(c) To subject to the action of oxygen or of an oxidizing agent, so
as to bring to a higher grade, as an -ous compound to an -ic
compound; as, to oxidize mercurous chloride to mercuric chloride.

Note: In certain cases to oxidize is identical with to acidify; for,
in nearly all cases, the more oxygen a substance contains the more
nearly does it approximate to acid qualities; thus, by oxidation many
elements, as sulphur, nitrogen, carbon, chromium, manganese, etc.,
pass into compounds which are acid anhydrides, and thus practically
in the acid state.

1. (Chem.)

Defn: A colorless, tasteless, odorless, gaseous element occurring in
the free state in the atmosphere, of which it forms about 23 per cent
by weight and about 21 per cent by volume, being slightly heavier
than nitrogen. Symbol O. Atomic weight 15.96.

Note: It occurs combined in immense quantities, forming eight ninths
by weight of water, and probably one half by weight of the entire
solid crust of the globe, being an ingredient of silica, the
silicates, sulphates, carbonates, nitrates, etc. Oxygen combines with
all elements (except fluorine), forming oxides, bases, oxyacid
anhydrides, etc., the process in general being called oxidation, of
which combustion is only an intense modification. At ordinary
temperatures with most substances it is moderately active, but at
higher temperatures it is one of the most violent and powerful
chemical agents known. It is indispensable in respiration, and in
general is the most universally active and efficient element. It may
be prepared in the pure state by heating potassium chlorate. This
element (called dephlogisticated air by Priestley) was named oxygen
by Lavoisier because he supposed it to be a constituent of all acids.
This is not so in the case of a very few acids (as hydrochloric,
hydrobromic, hydric sulphide, etc.), but these do contain elements
analogous to oxygen in property and action. Moreover, the fact that
most elements approach the nearer to acid qualities in proportion as
they are combined with more oxygen, shows the great accuracy and
breadth of Lavoisier's conception of its nature.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or

Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
