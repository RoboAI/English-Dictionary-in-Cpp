U

Defn: U, the twenty-first letter of the English alphabet, is a
cursive form of the letter V, with which it was formerly used
interchangeably, both letters being then used both as vowels and
consonants. U and V are now, however, differentiated, U being used
only as a vowel or semivowel, and V only as a consonant. The true
primary vowel sound of U, in Anglo-Saxon, was the sound which it
still retains in most of the languages of Europe, that of long oo, as
in tool, and short oo, as in wood, answering to the French ou in
tour. Etymologically U is most closely related to o, y (vowel), w,
and v; as in two, duet, dyad, twice; top, tuft; sop, sup; auspice,
aviary. See V, also O and Y. See Guide to Pronunciation, §§ 130-144.

See Anti-.]

Defn: An inseparable verbal prefix or particle. It is prefixed: (a)
To verbs to express the contrary, and not the simple negative, of the
action of the verb to which it is prefixed; as in uncoil, undo,
unfold. (b) To nouns to form verbs expressing privation of the thing,
quality, or state expressed by the noun, or separation from it; as in
unchild, unsex. Sometimes particles and participial adjectives formed
with this prefix coincide in form with compounds of the negative
prefix un- (see 2d Un-); as in undone (from undo), meaning
unfastened, ruined; and undone (from 2d un- and done) meaning not
done, not finished. Un- is sometimes used with an intensive force
merely; as in unloose.

Note: Compounds of this prefix are given in full in their proper
order in the Vocabulary.

UN-
Un-. Etym: [OE. & AS. un-; akin to OFries. un-, D. on-, OS., OHG., &
G. un-, Icel. o-, u-, Sw. o-, Dan. u-, W. an-, L. in-, Gr. an-, a-.
*193. Cf. A- not In- not, No, adv.]

Defn: An inseparable prefix, or particle, signifying not; in-; non-.
In- is prefixed mostly to words of Latin origin, or else to words
formed by Latin suffixes; un- is of much wider application, and is
attached at will to almost any adjective, or participle used
adjectively, or adverb, from which it may be desired to form a
corresponding negative adjective or adverb, and is also, but less
freely, prefixed to nouns. Un- sometimes has merely an intensive
force; as in unmerciless, unremorseless. I.

Defn: Un- is prefixed to adjectives, or to words used adjectively.
Specifically: --
(a) To adjectives, to denote the absence of the quality designated by
the adjective; as, ------ and the like.

(b) To past particles, or to adjectives formed after the analogy of
past particles, to indicate the absence of the condition or state
expressed by them; as, -Unabolishable Unabsolvable Unabsurd
Unabundant Unaccordant Unadoptable Unadventurous Unaffable
Unaffectionate Unafraid Unalliable Unallowablew Unalterable

Uncanonical Uncaptious Uncareful Uncelestial Unceremonious
Unchallengeable Unchangeable Unchary Unchastisable Uncheerful

---- and the like.

(c) To present particles which come from intransitive verbs, or are
themselves employed as adjectives, to mark the absence of the
activity, disposition, or condition implied by the participle; as, --
--- and the like.

Note: The above classes of words are unlimited in extent, and such
compounds may be formed by any writer or speaker at will from almost
all the adjectives or participles in the language, excepting those
which have a recognized and usual negative correspondent with the
prefix -in. No attempt will be made, therefore, to define them all in
this Dictionary; many will be omitted from its Vocabulary which are
negations of the simple word, and are readily explained by prefixing
a not to the latter. Derivatives of these words in -ly and -ness will
also, for the most part, be omitted for the same or similar reasons.
There will be inserted as separate articles with definitions, the
following: --1. Those which have acquired an opposed or contrary,
instead of a merely negative, meaning; as, unfriendly, ungraceful,
unpalatable, unquiet, and the like; or else an intensive sense more
than a prefixed not would express; as, unending, unparalleled,
undisciplined, undoubted, unsafe, and the like. 2. Those which have
the value of independent words, inasmuch as the simple words are
either not used at all, or are rarely, or at least much less
frequently, used; as, unavoidable, unconscionable, undeniable,
unspeakable, unprecedented, unruly, and the like; or inasmuch as they
are used in a different sense from the usual meaning of the
primitive, or especially in one of the significations of the latter;
as, unaccountable, unalloyed, unbelieving, unpretending, unreserved,
and the like; or inasmuch as they are so frequently and familiarly
used that they are hardly felt to be of negative origin; as,
uncertain, uneven, and the like. 3. Those which are anomalous,
provincial, or, for some other reason, not desirable to be used, and
are so indicated; as, unpure for impure, unsatisfaction for
dissatisfaction, unexpressible for inexpressible, and the like. II.

Defn: Un- is prefixed to nouns to express the absence of, or the
contrary of, that which the noun signifies; as, unbelief, unfaith,
unhealth, unrest, untruth, and the like.

Note: Compounds of this last class are given in full in their proper
order in the Vocabulary.

fall; pertaining to a propagated alternating motion, similar to that
of waves. Undulatory theory, or Wave theory (of light) (Opt.), that
theory which regards its various phenomena as due to undulations in
an ethereal medium, propagated from the radiant with immense, but
measurable, velocities, and producing different impressions on the
retina according to their amplitude and frequency, the sensation of
brightness depending on the former, that of color on the latter. The
undulations are supposed to take place, not in the direction of
propagation, as in the air waves constituting sound, but
transversely, and the various phenomena of refraction, polarization,
interference, etc., are attributable to the different affections of
these undulations in different circumstances of propagation. It is
computed that the frequency of the undulations corresponding to the
several colors of the spectrum ranges from 458 millions of millions
per second for the extreme red ray, to 727 millions of millions for
the extreme violet, and their lengths for the same colors, from the
thirty-eight thousandth to the sixty thousandth part of an inch. The

one. Unity is a state of simple oneness, either of essence, as the
unity of God, or of action, feeling, etc., as unity of design, of
affection, etc. Thus, we may speak of effecting a union of interests
which shall result in a unity of labor and interest in securing a
given object.

Defn: Of or pertaining to urine; obtained from urine; as, uric acid.
Uric acid, a crystalline body, present in small quantity in the urine
of man and most mammals. Combined in the form of urate of ammonia, it
is the chief constituent of the urine of birds and reptiles, forming
the white part. Traces of it are also found in the various organs of
the body. It is likewise a common constituent, either as the free
acid or as a urate, of urinary or renal calculi and of the so-called
gouty concretions. From acid urines, uric acid is frequently
deposited, on standing in a cool place, in the form of a reddish
yellow sediment, nearly always crystalline. Chemically, it is
composed of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen, C5H4N4O3, and by
decomposition yields urea, among other products. It can be made
synthetically by heating together urea and glycocoll. It was formerly
called also lithic acid, in allusion to its occurrence in stone, or
calculus.

URIM
U"rim, n. Etym: [Heb. , pl. of , fire light.]

Defn: A part or decoration of the breastplate of the high priest

And when Saul inquired of the Lord, the Lord answered him not,
neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets. 1 Sam. xxviii. 6.

Note: Professor Plumptre supposes the Urim to have been a clear and
colorless stone set in the breastplate of the high priest as a symbol
of light, answering to the mystic scarab in the pectoral plate of the
ancient Egyptian priests, and that the Thummim was an image
corresponding to that worn by the priestly judges of Egypt as a
symbol of truth and purity of motive. By gazing steadfastly on these,
he may have been thrown into a mysterious, half ecstatic state, akin
to hypnotism, in which he lost all personal consciousness, and
received a spiritual illumination and insight.

uric acid. Normally, it contains about 960 parts of water to 40 parts
of solid matter, and the daily average excretion is 35 grams (540
grains) of urea, 0.75 gram (11 grains) of uric acid, and 16.5 grams

Us"age, n. Etym: [F. usage, LL. usaticum. See Use.]

usage.
My brother Is prisoner to the bishop here, at whose hands He hath
good usage and great liberty. Shak.

2. Manners; conduct; behavior. [Obs.]
A gentle nymph was found, Hight Astery, excelling all the crew In
courteous usage. Spenser.

3. Long-continued practice; customary mode of procedure; custom;
habitual use; method. Chaucer.

Syn.
 -- Custom; use; habit.
 -- Usage, Custom. These words, as here compared, agree in expressing
the idea of habitual practice; but a custom is not necessarily a
usage. A custom may belong to many, or to a single individual. A
usage properly belongs to the great body of a people. Hence, we speak
of usage, not of custom, as the law of language. Again, a custom is
merely that which has been often repeated, so as to have become, in a
good degree, established. A usage must be both often repeated and of
long standing. Hence, we speak of a "hew custom," but not of a "new
usage." Thus, also, the "customs of society" is not so strong an
expression as the "usages of society." "Custom, a greater power than
nature, seldom fails to make them worship." Locke. "Of things once
received and confirmed by use, long usage is a law sufficient."
Hooker. In law, the words usage and custom are often used
interchangeably, but the word custom also has a technical and
restricted sense. See Custom, n., 3.

USAGER

Defn: One who has the use of anything in trust for another. [Obs.]

USE
Use, v. t. [imp. & p. p. Used; p. pr. & vb. n. Using.] Etym: [OE.
usen, F. user to use, use up, wear out, LL. usare to use, from L.
uti, p. p. usus, to use, OL. oeti, oesus; of uncertain origin. Cf.
Utility.]

Syn.
 -- Employ.
 -- Use, Employ. We use a thing, or make use of it, when we derive
from it some enjoyment or service. We employ it when we turn that
service into a particular channel. We use words to express our
general meaning; we employ certain technical terms in reference to a
given subject. To make use of, implies passivity in the thing; as, to
make use of a pen; and hence there is often a material difference
between the two words when applied to persons. To speak of "making
use of another" generally implies a degrading idea, as if we had used
him as a tool; while employ has no such sense. A confidential friend
is employed to negotiate; an inferior agent is made use of on an
intrigue.
I would, my son, that thou wouldst use the power Which thy discretion
gives thee, to control And manage all. Cowper.
To study nature will thy time employ: Knowledge and innocence are

Syn.

which forbid the hope of success, as fruitless when it fails, not
from any such difficulties, but from some unexpected hindrance

death of its projector. Ineffectual nearly resembles fruitless, but
implies a failure of a less hopeless character; as, after several
ineffectual efforts, I at last succeeded.
Useless are all words Till you have writ "performance" with your
swords. The other is for waiving. Beau. & Fl.
Waiving all searches into antiquity, in relation to this controversy,

former opinion, together with the fact that the nature of money makes
it easier for the lender to oppress the borrower, has caused nearly
all Christian nations to fix by law the rate of compensation for the
use of money. Of late years, however, the opinion that money should
be borrowed and repaid, or bought and sold, upon whatever terms the
parties should agree to, like any other property, has gained ground
everywhere. Am. Cyc.

Syn.
 -- Usefulness; advantageous; benefit; profit; avail; service.

utility is Latin; and hence the former is used chiefly of things in
the concrete, while the latter is employed more in a general and
abstract sense. Thus, we speak of the utility of an invention, and
the usefulness of the thing invented; of the utility of an

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
