H

Defn: the eighth letter of the English alphabet, is classed among the
consonants, and is formed with the mouth organs in the same position
as that of the succeeding vowel. It is used with certain consonants
to form digraphs representing sounds which are not found in the
alphabet, as sh, th, th, as in shall, thing, thine (for zh see §274);
also, to modify the sounds of some other letters, as when placed
after c and p, with the former of which it represents a compound
sound like that of tsh, as in charm (written also tch as in catch),
with the latter, the sound of f, as in phase, phantom. In some words,
mostly derived or introduced from foreign languages, h following c
and g indicates that those consonants have the hard sound before e,
i, and y, as in chemistry, chiromancy, chyle, Ghent, Ghibelline,
etc.; in some others, ch has the sound of sh, as in chicane. See
Guide to Pronunciation, §§ 153, 179, 181-3, 237-8.

Note: The name (aitch) is from the French ache; its form is from the
Latin, and this from the Greek H, which was used as the sign of the
spiritus asper (rough breathing) before it came to represent the long
vowel, Gr. ê. The Greek H is from Phoenician, the ultimate origin
probably being Egyptian. Etymologically H is most closely related to
c; as in E. horn, L. cornu, Gr. ke`ras; E. hele, v. t., conceal; E.
hide, L. cutis, Gr. ky`tos; E. hundred, L. centum, Gr. 'e-kat-on,
Skr. csata. H piece (Mining), the part of a plunger pump which

acquired the idea of training, cultivation, symmetry, and proportion,
which enters so largely into our conception of handsome. Thus Drayton
makes mention of handsome players, meaning those, who are well
trained; and hence we speak of a man's having a handsome address,
which is the result of culture; of a handsome horse or dog, which
implies well proportioned limbs; of a handsome face, to which, among
other qualities, the idea of proportion and a graceful contour are
essential; of a handsome tree, and a handsome house or villa. So,
from this idea of proportion or suitableness, we have, with a
different application, the expressions, a handsome fortune, a
handsome offer.

Syn.
 -- To aid; assist; succor; relieve; serve; support; sustain;
befriend.
 -- To Help, Aid, Assist. These words all agree in the idea of
affording relief or support to a person under difficulties. Help
turns attention especially to the source of relief. If I fall into a
pit, I call for help; and he who helps me out does it by an act of
his own. Aid turns attention to the other side, and supposes
coöperation on the part of him who is relieved; as, he aided me in
getting out of the pit; I got out by the aid of a ladder which he
brought. Assist has a primary reference to relief afforded by a
person who "stands by" in order to relieve. It denotes both help and
aid. Thus, we say of a person who is weak, I assisted him upstairs,
or, he mounted the stairs by my assistance. When help is used as a
noun, it points less distinctively and exclusively to the source of
relief, or, in other words, agrees more closely with aid. Thus we
say, I got out of a pit by the help of my friend.

Horse, n. Etym: [AS. hors; akin to OS. hros, D. & OHG. ros, G. ross,

1. (Zoöl.)

Defn: A hoofed quadruped of the genus Equus; especially, the domestic
horse (E. caballus), which was domesticated in Egypt and Asia at a
very early period. It has six broad molars, on each side of each jaw,
with six incisors, and two canine teeth, both above and below. The
mares usually have the canine teeth rudimentary or wanting. The horse
differs from the true asses, in having a long, flowing mane, and the
tail bushy to the base. Unlike the asses it has callosities, or
chestnuts, on all its legs. The horse excels in strength, speed,
docility, courage, and nobleness of character, and is used for
drawing, carrying, bearing a rider, and like purposes.

Note: Many varieties, differing in form, size, color, gait, speed,
etc., are known, but all are believed to have been derived from the
same original species. It is supposed to have been a native of the
plains of Central Asia, but the wild species from which it was
derived is not certainly known. The feral horses of America are
domestic horses that have run wild; and it is probably true that most
of those of Asia have a similar origin. Some of the true wild Asiatic
horses do, however, approach the domestic horse in several
characteristics. Several species of fossil (Equus) are known from the
later Tertiary formations of Europe and America. The fossil species
of other genera of the family Equidæ are also often called horses, in
general sense.

as, a regiment of horse; -- distinguished from foot.

Syn.
 -- However, At least, Nevertheless, Yet. These words, as here
compared, have an adversative sense in reference to something
referred to in the context. However is the most general, and leads to
a final conclusion or decision. Thus we say, the truth, however, has
not yet fully come out; i.e., such is the speaker's conclusion in
view of the whole case. So also we say, however, you may rely on my
assistance to that amount; i. e., at all events, whatever may happen,
this is my final decision. At least is adversative in another way. It
points out the utmost concession that can possibly be required, and
still marks the adversative conclusion; as, at least, this must be
done; whatever may be our love of peace, we must at least maintain
the rights of conscience. Nevertheless denotes that though the
concession be fully made, it has no bearing of the question; as,
nevertheless, we must go forward. Yet signifies that however extreme
the supposition or fact comceded may be, the consequence which might
naturally be expected does not and will not follow; as, though I
should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee; though he slay me,
yet will I trust in him. Cf. But.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
