consonant. It has two sounds; one simple, as in gave, go, gull; the

necessarily the lowest definable group of species, for it may often
be divided into several subgenera. In proportion as its definition is
exact, it is natural genus; if its definition can not be made clear,
it is more or less an artificial genus.

Note: Thus in the animal kingdom the lion, leopard, tiger, cat, and
panther are species of the Cat kind or genus, while in the vegetable
kingdom all the species of oak form a single genus. Some genera are
represented by a multitude of species, as Solanum (Nightshade) and
Carex (Sedge), others by few, and some by only one known species.
Subaltern genus (Logic), a genus which may be a species of a higher
genus, as the genus denoted by quadruped, which is also a species of
mammal.

requires any other curve, or such motion of a line or circle as would
generate any other curve, is not geometrical, but mechanical. By

yellow. Yellow, and cf. Gild, v. t.]

1. (Chem.)

Defn: A metallic element, constituting the most precious metal used
as a common commercial medium of exchange. It has a characteristic
yellow color, is one of the heaviest substances known (specific
gravity 19.32), is soft, and very malleable and ductile. It is quite
unalterable by heat, moisture, and most corrosive agents, and
therefore well suited for its use in coin and jewelry. Symbol Au
(Aurum). Atomic weight 196.7.

Note: Native gold contains usually eight to ten per cent of silver,
but often much more. As the amount of silver increases, the color
becomes whiter and the specific gravity lower. Gold is very widely
disseminated, as in the sands of many rivers, but in very small
quantity. It usually occurs in quartz veins (gold quartz), in slate
and metamorphic rocks, or in sand and alluvial soil, resulting from
the disintegration of such rocks. It also occurs associated with
other metallic substances, as in auriferous pyrites, and is combined
with tellurium in the minerals petzite, calaverite, sylvanite, etc.
Pure gold is too soft for ordinary use, and is hardened by alloying
with silver and copper, the latter giving a characteristic reddish
tinge. [See Carat.] Gold also finds use in gold foil, in the pigment
purple of Cassius, and in the chloride, which is used as a toning
agent in photography.

2. Money; riches; wealth.
For me, the gold of France did not seduce. Shak.

3. A yellow color, like that of the metal; as, a flower tipped with

spretus), noted for the great extent of its ravages in the region
beyond the Mississippi. In the Eastern United States the red-legged
(Caloptenus femurrubrum and C. atlanis) are closely related species,

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
